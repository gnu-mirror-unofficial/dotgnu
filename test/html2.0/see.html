<H1>Secure Execution Environment daemon</H1>
SEE will be a deamon implementing a secure execution environent.  This
project is <A href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu-see/">under
development at Savannah</A>.
<P>
SEE will support plugins that can be implemented in any language that
is supported by gcc.
<P>
In addition, there will be a plugin that can execute Java bytecode,
as well as "Portable Executables" containing Microsoft's IL
("Intermediate Language") which is also a kind of bytecode.
That will allow SEE to receive programs in these bytecode formats via
the internet and executem them in a secure manner.
<P>
Other bytecode formats, such as Python bytecode, or the bytecode of
Perl6, could be supported by similar plugins.
