<H1>DotGNU - Making the Web Work for You!</H1>
We're building something that could be called an "operating system
for the internet" - a collection of tools that allow software
components to interact with each other over the internet.  The
most impressive parts are currently
<A href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">DotGNU
Portable.NET</A> which builds a C# compiler, class library, and
related development tools, and
<A href="http://www.phpgroupware.org/">phpGroupWare</A>, a multi-user
web-based GroupWare suite, which also serves to provide a good
collection of webservice components, all of which can be accessed
through XML-RPC so that you can easily integrate them into webservice
applications of your own.  
<P>
DotGNU is really a meta-project that will consist of a good number
of such <A href="projects.html">software development projects</A>.
The main objectives of DotGNU are to build a
<A href="arch.html">webservices platform</A> and a
<A href="auth.html">Virtual Identities</A> system.
<H1>DotGNU - Keeping You from Getting Tangled in a Net!</H1>
The DotGNU project was originally started in reaction to Microsoft's
.NET strategy, for which it will be a complete replacement (and not
just a Free Software implementation).  The part of .NET strategy about
which we are most concerned is
<A href="http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a//p2p/2001/05/30/hailstorm.html">Hailstorm</A>
(recently renamed <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/myservices/services/userexperiences.asp">".NET My Services"</A>), which is in fact Microsoft's
attempt to gain control of the internet and its users.  In contrast,
the goal of DotGNU is to give computer users full freedom to use the
internet as they want.  For example, the DotGNU approach to 
<A href="web-services.html">"web services"</A> will make it possible
for end users to run webservice software on their own PC, so that the
users are not forced to migrate their data to the webservice servers.
<P>
DotGNU will use a decentralized paradigm: No single company, server or
entity will control authorization.  This avoids privacy problems like
those recently pointed out in <A
href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/consumer/microsoft/stateagletter.html">a
letter from the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) on
Microsoft's Passport system.</A>
<P>Furthermore, DotGNU will emphasize security, it
will use encryption wherever possible to keep user data secure and
hidden.   (According to the article
<A href="http://avirubin.com/passport.html">Risks of the Passport
Single Signon Protocol</A>[1], Microsoft's approach has some
fundamental problems in the area of security.  In fact it appears
that <A
href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2814881,00.html">Microsoft
is storing the password and username for Passport as clear text</A>,
a huge security risk.)  Because of entirely unrelated, serious
security problems,
<A href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,48105,00.html">Microsoft
was forced on Nov 2, 2001 to disabled the "virtual wallet" function of
the Passport service</A> as Marc Slemko
<A href="http://alive.znep.com/~marcs/passport/">published a sample
exploit that demonstrates a cross-site scripting vulnerability.</A>
<P>
There are no real remaining traditional competitors to MS, and the US
government recently failed to contain MS, so the field is left to us. MS has
announced that it has "bet the company" on .Net, because "Webservices"
represents the future, and Windows and MS Office will become progressively
less important. So DotGNU stands between where MS is and where it wants to
be. Therefore DotGNU and .Net represents the ultimate showdown between
proprietary and Free Software.
<H2>Don't read unpublished Microsoft information</H2>
In order to avoid falling into any legal traps, please be extremely
careful to avoid reading any unpublished information from Microsoft.
<P>
We ask every contributor to disclose exactly how much exposure they've
had to Microsoft stuff, and make them commit to report any additional
exposure immediately.  Whenever there is even the slightest shade of a
possible problem,  the contributor needs to refrain from contributing
until our legal team has been established and it has provided
appropriate advice.

<H2>General Information about the DotGNU Project</H2>
DotGNU is being developed jointly under the auspices
of <A href="http://freedevelopers.net">FreeDevelopers</A>
and the <A href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</A>.
The DotGNU system will be a well-integrated part of the
<A href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU system</A>
and it will also be made available to the users of all other
widely-used operation systems.  If you wish to receive important
announcements about the DotGNU project, please subscribe to the
<A href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">
   DotGNU announcements mailing list</A>.
<H3>Where will DotGNU compete with the Microsoft .Net
    and Hailstorm products?</H3>
In all areas.
<P>
Just like it's the goal of the <A href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</A>
to create a complete operating system that makes it completely
unnecessary to use a non-free operating system like e.g. Microsoft
Windows, it's the goal of the DotGNU project to be a complete
competitor to Microsoft's ".Net initiative" and "Hailstorm" products.
<P>
The DotGNU project will compete with Microsoft for end-users,
business customers and developers.
<P>
Microsoft Windows had a huge head start over GNU/Linux in terms
of user-friendliness to end users.  In spite of Microsoft's vast
resources, GNU/Linux is already better than Microsoft Windows in
some areas, and catching up fast in most others.
<P>
We believe that the same kind of success story is possible with
the DotGNU project.  The main difference is that this time,
Microsoft doesn't have such a big head start.
<H3>What will DotGNU do that those products also want to do?</H3>
The DotGNU system will deliver the same and better benefits to end
users and business customers, but we will be very careful that no
company or other organization can gain any monopoly-like power over
the system.
<H3>How will DotGNU be different from those Microsoft products?</H3>
The DotGNU project will use good ideas from Microsoft as a
source of inspiration, and Microsoft will probably also use
good ideas from the DotGNU project as a source of inspiration.
<P>
The big difference is that there is a single company (Microsoft)
in the center of the universe of the ".Net initiative" and
"Hailstorm" products,  while the DotGNU project creates a
framework where anyone who wants can offer every service.
For example, with DotGNU every Internet Service Provider (ISP)
can offer the equivalent of Microsoft's "Passport" service,
and the ISP can customize and modify this service according to
their customers' needs.
<P>
In the DotGNU system, the paradigm of decentralization goes so far
that whenever an Application Service Provider (ASP) makes a program
available to a customer, the customer is not forced to use the program
only on the Application Service Provider's computers.  The customers
can download the program and use it locally on their own PCs.  This is
in strong contrast to the Microsoft's vision for
<A href="web-services.html">"web services"</A>.
<H3>What do you guys think about Hailstorm and Passport?</H3>
Hailstorms tend to be destructive.  And one should not need to use a
passport in one's own country.<sup>2</sup>
<H3>What do you guys think of Microsoft's .Net and Hailstorm efforts?</H3>
Dangerous stuff.  It is often said that the price of freedom is
eternal vigilance.<sup>3</sup> Unless we counter them, Microsoft's efforts
are not only a threat to Free Software, they are also extremely
dangerous tools in the hands of any Evil Government that wants
to make their citizens unfree.

rights become a prey to the active. The condition upon which God hath
given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he
break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the
punishment of his guilt." - <EM>John Philpot Curran: Speech upon the
