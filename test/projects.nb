<H1>DotGNU Software Development Projects</H1>
The <A href="index.html">DotGNU vision</a> is so big that for
practical reasons DotGNU must be organized as a meta-project
that serves as an umbrella for at least ten to twenty 
software development projects.
<P>
There are two main tracks of development of DotGNU, each of which can
have any number of DotGNU projects.  New projects can be proposed and
discussed at any time, as explained on the
<A href="/proposals/">proposals page</A>.
<H2>DotGNU Platform</H2>
This webservices platform will support p2p communication between
multiple webservices servers, so that they can keep their databases in
synch.
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Portable.NET</STRONG>
   <P>For strategic reasons, the DotGNU Platform must be "downward
    compatible" to Microsoft's .NET, in the sense that programs
    ("Portable Executables") that have been created for .NET must
    run on the DotGNU platform.
   <P>The DotGNU project that is responsible for ensuring this
    compatibility is the 
    <A href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">DotGNU
    Portable.NET</A> project led by Rhys Weatherley.
   <P>This is a high-priority project.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>Support for Java bytecode</STRONG>
   <P>The invention of the new language C# is a strategic move of
    Microsoft against the successful Java language.  (It seems that
    Microsoft wants to fight against everything that is successful
    and not under the control of Microsoft).  DotGNU wants to support
    Java and the various languages that can be compiled to Java
    bytecode, so we need a JVM implementation for the DotGNU Platform.
   <P>Maybe this will be implemented as part of the pnet package.
   <P>This isn't actively being worked on yet.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Secure Execution Environment</STRONG>
   <P>Portable Executables that come in one of the multiple bytecode
    formats supported by the DotGNU platform will be executed in a
    <A href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu-see/">DotGNU
    Secure Execution Environment.</A>  In order to facilitate remote
    execution, this will probably implemented as a daemon, and there
    is code for a test daemon called Andromeda which demonstrated how
    plugins can be bound to the daemon.
   <P>This is a high-priority project.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Distributed Execution Environment</STRONG>
   <P>DotGNU's Distributed Execution Environment will be like an
    operating system for a "distributed computer" consisting of
    several instances of the "DotGNU Secure Execution Environment"
    that are running on several computers.  This system must be able
    to take care of replicating databases across all the parts of this
    "distributed computer" and propagating updates.
   <P>This isn't actively being worked on yet.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>Distributed Filesystem</STRONG>
   <P>This may eventually be a key component of the DotGNU
    Distributed Execution Environment.  It has not been decided yet
    whether this should be considered a high-priority or a low-priority
    project.
   <P>This isn't actively being worked on yet.
   <P>
</UL>
<H2>DotGNU Virtual Identities</H2>
This will be a totally decentralized authentication / personal
information system that can compete with Microsoft's "Passport"
system.  This system will eventually implemented as an application
that runs on the DotGNU platform.  Unlike other applications it makes
sense to develop this application under the umbrella of the DotGNU
meta-project, because authentication is also an essential component of
every operating system.
<P>
There are several active projects in this area, but none of them is
officially part of the GNU project yet.  They're listed on the
<A href="proposals/active.html">Active Proposals page</A>.
