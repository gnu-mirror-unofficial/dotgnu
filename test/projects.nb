<H1>DotGNU Software Development Projects</H1>
The <A href="index.html">DotGNU vision</a> is so big that for
practical reasons DotGNU must be organized as a meta-project
that serves as an umbrella for at least ten to twenty 
software development projects.
<P>
There are two main tracks of development of DotGNU, each of which can
have any number of DotGNU projects.  New projects can be proposed and
discussed on the
<A href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/developers">DotGNU
developers mailing list.</A>
<H2>DotGNU Platform</H2>
This will be like an <A href="arch.html">operating system for
distributed computing</A>.
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Portable.NET</STRONG>
   <P>For strategic reasons, the DotGNU Platform must be "downward
    compatible" to Microsoft's .NET, in the sense that programs
    ("Portable Executables") that have been created for .NET must
    run on the DotGNU platform.
   <P>The DotGNU project that is responsible for ensuring this
    compatibility is the DotGNU Portable.NET project led by
    Rhys Weatherley. It consists of two major components:
    <UL>
      <LI><A href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">pnet</A>
      consists of the C#->IL compiler, the runtime
      engine, and other tools to manipulate portable executables.
      The current version is
      <A href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/download/pnet-0.1.8.tar.gz"
      >0.1.8</A>
      <LI><A href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net_lib.html"
      >pnetlib</A> contains the C# lbrary.  The current version is
      <A href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/download/pnetlib-0.0.2.tar.gz"
      >0.0.2</A>.
    </UL>
   <P>This is a high-priority project.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>Support for Java bytecode</STRONG>
   <P>The invention of the new language C# is a strategic move of
    Microsoft against the successful Java language.  (It seems that
    Microsoft wants to fight against everything that is successful
    and not under the control of Microsoft).  DotGNU wants to support
    Java and the various languages that can be compiled to Java
    bytecode, so we need a JVM implementation for the DotGNU Platform.
   <P>Maybe this will be implemented as part of the pnet package.
   <P>This is a high-priority project.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>Another bytecode language</STRONG>
   <P>There is work on progress on a new, very rich bytecode language
    that will contain a lot of semantic information which can
    optionally be used by a bytecode -> machine code compiler or JITer
    for purposes of optimization.  These ideas are very cool, but it
    will probably take a long time before this new bytecode format can
    compete with IL and Java bytecode.
   <P>This is a low-priority project.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Secure Execution Environment</STRONG>
   <P>Portable Executables that come in one of the multiple bytecode
    formats supported by the DotGNU platform will be executed in a
    <A href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu-see/">DotGNU
    Secure Execution Environment.</A>  In order to facilitate remote
    execution, this will probably implemented as a daemon, and there
    is code for a test daemon called Andromeda which demonstrated how
    plugins can be bound to the daemon.
   <P>This is a high-priority project.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Distributed Execution Environment</STRONG>
   <P>DotGNU's Distributed Execution Environment will be like an
    operating system for a "distributed computer" consisting of
    several instances of the "DotGNU Secure Execution Environment"
    that are running on several computers.  This system must be able
    to take care of replicating databases across all the parts of this
    "distributed computer" and propagating updates.
   <P>This is a high-priority project.
   <P>
  <LI><STRONG>Distributed Filesystem</STRONG>
   <P>This will eventually be a key component of the DotGNU
    Distributed Execution Environment.  It has not been decided yet
    whether this should be considered a high-priority or a low-priority
    project.
</UL>
<H2>DotGNU Virtual Identities</H2>
This will be a totally decentralized authentication / personal
information system that can compete with Microsoft's "Passport"
system.  This system will eventually implemented as an application
that runs on the DotGNU platform.  Unlike other applications it makes
sense to develop this application under the umbrella of the DotGNU
meta-project, because authentication is also an essential component of
every operating system.
<P>
There is work in progress on a very simple "single login system" that
will allow us to start competing with Microsoft's "Passport" system
even before the DotGNU platform is ready.
