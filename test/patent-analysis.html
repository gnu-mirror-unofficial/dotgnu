</FONT><h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">1. Introduction</FONT></h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

This document is an analysis of the McAfee patent #6,266,774, explaining
what it does and does not cover.  We hope to dispell the myth that this
covers all application service providers.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

This document was prepared in part to assist the DotGNU project,
<a href="http://www.dotgnu.org/">http://www.dotgnu.org/</a>, a
free software initiative under the auspices of the GNU project,
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a> and FreeDevelopers,
<a href="http://www.freedevelopers.net/">http://www.freedevelopers.net/</a>.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

We concentrate on the claims in the patent, not the description or
McAfee's press releases.  Only the claims have legal weight.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Nothing in this document should be construed as legal advice.  It is
an independent review by a computer programmer, not a patent attorney.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

If you discover any issues with this document, or other examples of
prior art, please e-mail the author.</FONT><p><h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">2. Overview of the patent</FONT></h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

The patent was filed on December 8, 1998, and granted July 24, 2001.
The abstract is as follows:

<blockquote>
A system, method, and computer program product for delivery and automatic
execution of security, management, or optimization software over an
Internet connection to a user computer responsive to a user request
entered via a web browser on the user computer. In a preferred embodiment,
the user directs the Internet browser to a Internet clinical services
provider web site computer and logs in to the site using an identifier and
a secure password and optionally makes a selection of the type of
servicing desired, wherein an automatically-executing software package
encapsulated within a markup language communication unit deliverable
across the Internet is delivered, to the user computer, the
automatically-executing software package being adapted to perform
security, management, or optimization functions on the user computer. User
identifiers and passwords enabling the downloads may be provided on a
per-download basis or on a subscription basis.
</blockquote>

Essentially, the patent covers a system for automatically downloading
security patches and virus scanner updates over the Internet.  This
is hardly an earth-shattering achievement: any competent Internet
programmer could devise such a scheme.  As we will see, the claims
are obvious to a practicioner of computer programming.</FONT><p><h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">3. The main claims</FONT></h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

All patents contain two kinds of claims: main and re-statements.  The
main claims are the core of the patent.  The re-stated claims modify 
the main claims to cover extensions or variations.  There are three main
claims in this patent: 1, 12, and 14.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
1. A method for automatically performing one or more maintenance tasks on a
remotely located computer connected to a server computer via a data
network, said method comprising the steps of:

</FONT><ul>
<li>directing an Internet browser on the remotely located computer to form a
    logical connection with the server computer;
<li>delivering a software package to the remotely located computer across said
    logical connection, said software package being encapsulated within a
    markup language communication unit deliverable across said logical
    connection, said software package comprising scripts for performing said
    one or more maintenance tasks on the remotely located computer; and
<li>automatically executing the scripts for performing said one or more
    maintenance tasks on the remotely located computer.
</ul><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This claim describes the software and activities on the "remotely located
computer", which is the user's machine.  The machine is directed to connect
to the server, download a set of maintainence tasks as a "markup communication
unit", and execute the maintainence tasks.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Prior art for this isn't hard to find: any system that downloads a shell
script from a server for automatic execution on a client would be sufficient.
Unix systems in the early 1990's regularly used the technique of loading
shell scripts via NFS from a remote server.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

More recently, Red Hat Linux systems use RPM files to automatically apply
security patches consisting of both software updates, and commands to be
executed.  RPM files can be downloaded by the user with a Web browser,
or via direct connection to a HTTP server.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Claim 1 attempts to make things different by using an Internet browser and
a markup language.  But these are just recent incarnations of a very old,
and obvious, idea.  Namely, administration is more efficient if it can
be centralised.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

This claim is vague as to who or what performs the "directing".  Is
it the user themselves?  An automated process installed on user's machine?
Or the server computer?  The first interpretation is no different than regular
Web traffic.  The second interpretation is no different than a Unix machine
using NFS to download a shell script at pre-determined times.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

The patent description is also vague, but the third would seem to be
the most likely interpretation.  That is, the server sends some information
to the user's Web browser to cause it to accept the download of the software
package on a secondary connection.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

There are two sources of prior art for this: FTP and HTTP redirects.  FTP
servers negotiate with their clients to set up a secondary connection to
exchange data files.  HTTP redirects can also be used to force a Web
browser to visit a secondary Web site that performs data transfer.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
12. A computer program product for execution by a server computer for
enabling the maintenance of a remote user computer coupled to the server
computer over a network, comprising:

</FONT><ul>
<li>computer code for receiving a user request from the remote user computer,
    said user request being entered by the user via a web browser;
<li>computer code for instantiating a download of a maintenance software
    package to a storage medium connected to the user computer via the web
    browser; and
<li>computer code for causing said maintenance software to automatically
    execute on the user computer subsequent to downloading;
<li>whereby, responsive only to said user-entered request via said web browser,
    advanced maintenance routines may be performed on said user computer
    without requiring local maintenance commands from said user.
</ul><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This describes the Web server that is providing the service to the user
machine described in claim 1.  It is obvious that any gadget that conforms
to the description of claim 1 will need to talk to a gadget that conforms
to the description of claim 12.  Otherwise the claim 1 gadget cannot
function successfully.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

All known Web servers that existed one year prior to the patent filing
date provide the above functionality.  The more usual name for the client
part of the mechanism is "browser plug-ins", which are activated by
information supplied by the server upon user request.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

If the third interpretation of "directing" in claim 1 is the correct one,
then existing Web servers provide all of the functionality except the
establishment of the secondary connection.  Such functionality is more
common to FTP servers.  The patent has combined the functionality of
HTTP and FTP in the most obvious manner possible.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
14. A computer-readable medium, comprising:

</FONT><ul>
<li>means for directing a server computer to encapsulate a self-executing
    software maintenance program into a markup language communication unit
    deliverable across the Internet;
<li>means for directing the server computer to receive a user command over the
    Internet, said user command being received from a user via a web browser
    installed on a remote user computer;
<li>means for transmitting said encapsulated self-executing software
    maintenance program to said user remote computer responsive to said user
    command, whereby said software maintenance program is executed responsive
    only to commands entered from the user into the web browser.
</ul><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This refers to the mechanism used to represent and deliver the software
updates as the "markup language communication unit".  Packaging software
for download is not new: the ZIP format has existed since the early 1990's
for precisely this purpose.  Incorporating additional script commands is
also quite common: the shar archive format was doing this in the late 1980's,
and the RPM format is a more recent example from the mid-1990's.  All of
these predate the patent filing date by at least a year.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

The first part of this claim is vague as to when the unit is generated.
Is it generated once for all users and stored for download?  If so, then
claim 14 is precisely the same as ZIP, shar, and RPM in functionality.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Alternatively, the unit may be generated "on the fly" in the server.
The unit can thus be customized to the specific maintainence tasks
required by the user's machine.  Previous systems did not normally
do this, because it is inefficient.  However, if an administrator of
a previous system wanted to build such a system, it would be quite
obvious how to do so.  Packaging software is fully automatable and
configurable.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

There is some prior art for packaging software "on the fly" in a
server.  The wu-ftpd FTP server can automatically package the contents
of a directory as a "tar" file for download to a user's machine.
Because the server does not know ahead of time which directories the
user may wish to download, it must perform the task upon request.</FONT><p><h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">4. Restating the obvious</FONT></h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

With any system that uses the Internet, there are various practical
considerations that must be taken into account: security, transaction
logging, dynamic notification, etc.  Claims 2 through 11, and 13 enumerate
these, just in case the reader was unable to figure them out
for themselves.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
2. The method of claim 1, said step of directing including a registering
step, said registering step comprising the steps of:

</FONT><ul>
<li>downloading a web page located on the server computer using the Internet
    browser;
<li>entering an identifier and a secure password on said web page; and
<li>selecting an option presented on the web page to send the identifier and
    password to the server computer;
<li>wherein said step of delivering the software package is enabled only if a
    user has provided a valid identifier and password.
</ul><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This claim adds an extra Web page to the start of the process, to allow the
user to login to the server that supplies the security updates.  Since
the server is providing security updates for particular machines, some way
is needed to identify those machines.  A username/password scheme is an
obvious way of achieving this, if not a particularly secure one.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising the steps of:

</FONT><ul>
<li>creating a transaction log on the server computer; and
<li>recording information related to said steps of registering and delivering
    in the said transaction log.
</ul><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This claim says that the server records every security update transaction
in a log of some kind.  Since Web servers normally keep logs of every request
anyway, this claim is just restating the normal functions of a Web server.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

We will note here that keeping logs of every update made to a machine is
probably a violation of the user's privacy.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of generating a
periodic activity report for the remotely located computer.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

To compound the privacy concerns, this claim says that the server has
some mechanism to summarise the activities of the user.  In any case,
it is a normal function of Web servers to provide some way to summarise
the logs according to various criteria.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

However, this analysis may be incorrect.  Perhaps claim 4 does not refer
to summarising the user's activity for the server administrators.  It may
refer to summarising the activity for the user themselves to view.  It is
fairly obvious that a way to summarise activity for the administrator can
be trivially turned into a way for the user to access the same information.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising the step of transmitting an
electronic message in an e-mail format from the server computer to the
remotely located computer indicating that a new product or a new
application is available for download.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

It is quite common for Web sites to automatically e-mail registered
users about updates or new offerings.  This claim is not adding
anything new.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
6. The method of claim 5, said logical connection with the server computer
being a secure network connection.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This claim says that the patent still holds if the information is sent
over a secure connection.  That is, the user accesses the server and
downloads the software package using SSL rather than a raw connection.
It is obvious to anyone familiar with Internet protocols that any information
that is sent via an insecure channel can also be sent by a secure channel.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
7. The method of claim 6, said software package including a program to
detect computer viruses on the remotely located computer.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

Previous claims have left it fairly open as to the type of software
that was being transferred, except to say that the software is
performing maintainence operations.  Should the previous claims be
found to be too broad, then this claim is engaged to say that the
particular case of virus scanning programs is still covered.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

This claim is really what the patent is all about: automatic downloading
of virus scanners and updates.  Thus, vendors of virus scanning software
may have something to fear from this patent, but few other companies will.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

We will state though that it is pretty obvious that the Internet can
be used to distribute programs and program updates of any kind.  This has
been one of its primary functions since its earliest days.  Virus scanners and
updates are no different to any other kind of software in this regard.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
8. The method of claim 2, further comprising the steps of:

</FONT><ul>
<li>before or during registering the remotely located computer, creating an
    account for a user of the remotely located computer on the server
    computer; and
<li>identifying said identifier and password as valid if the user has a current
    subscription or a positive fund balance in said user account.
</ul><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

The first part of this claim says that an account should be automatically
created for new users.  This is a common feature of most Web sites that
require user registration.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

The second part of this claim says that the user should only be authorised
by the login mechanism if they are properly subscribed and if sufficient
funds are available in their personal account.  The fundamental requirement
of e-commerce, that no service shall be supplied without payment, makes
it pretty obvious that such a check needs to be performed at some point.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising the step of transmitting
payment information from the remotely located computer to the server
computer in an electronic mail message format, wherein said account may
reflect a current subscription or an increased fund balance upon receipt
of said payment information.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This claim says that payment information may be sent to the server in
an e-mail message.  Presumably this information would include credit
card details, or some other form of payment.  Obviously, some means
is needed to communicate to the server how payment should be achieved.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Interestingly, the patent only mentions sending payment information
via e-mail, and not by direct entry on a Web page.  This oversight makes
it very easy for competitors to avoid infringing this aspect of the patent.
They need only require their users to access a Web page to provide payment
information.  Since Web pages are easier to secure using SSL than e-mail,
this will result in a better system for the users.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising the steps of:

</FONT><ul>
<li>generating an electronic receipt on the server computer; and
<li>transmitting the receipt to the remotely located computer.
</ul><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This claims says that a receipt is generated and transmitted after the payment
information is supplied.  This is an obvious requirement for any e-commerce
system.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
11. The method of claim 1 wherein said one or more maintenance tasks
comprise at least one of the following: compression of software,
compression of data, search for software that needs to be upgraded, search
for data that needs to be upgraded, upgrade of software, upgrade of data,
search for obsolete software, search for obsolete data, deletion of
obsolete software, deletion of obsolete data, archival of software,
archival of data, hardware diagnostics, and software diagnostics.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This claim attempts to enumerate all of the tasks that may need to be
performed during software maintainence.  This list is hardly surprising:
every system administrator since the dawn of computing has performed
these tasks, or written automated scripts to perform the tasks for them.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
13. The computer program product of claim 12, further comprising computer
code for receiving payment or subscription information from the user,
whereby said maintenance software package is downloaded to the user
computer only upon receiving valid payment information or current
subscription information from the user.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">
</blockquote>

This modifies claim 12 to include the ability to process the user's
payment or subscription information.  This is an obvious requirement
for communicating with any client that conforms to claim 8.</FONT><p><h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">5. Prior art</FONT></h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Symantec's HealthyPC program may be sufficient prior art.  The
following is from a CNET news article, dated April 28, 1997:

<blockquote>
During the quarter, Symantec and ZDNet launched HealthyPC.com, a Web site
that emphasizes PC maintenance. It offers two separate services: a free
advice and consultation area maintained by ZDNet and a subscription-based
service with access to Symantec's antivirus, utility, and LiveUpdate software.
[<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-318512.html">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-318512.html</a>].
</blockquote>

If HealthyPC is not sufficient prior art, then any Unix machine from the
early 1990's that downloaded a shell script via NFS and executed it should
be sufficient.  RPM is also sufficient, and is even closer to the
patent than shell/NFS.  Automatic shell script download and execution is
basically all this patent is about: the technologies have changed slightly,
but the concept is identical.  The USPTO guidelines on this are quite
clear:</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

<blockquote>
Even if the subject matter sought to be patented is not exactly shown
by the prior art, and involves one or more differences over the
most nearly similar thing already known, a patent may still be refused
if the differences would be obvious. The subject matter sought to
be patented must be sufficiently different from what has been used
or described before that it may be said to be nonobvious to a person
having ordinary skill in the area of technology related to the invention.
For example, the substitution of one material for another, or
changes in size, are ordinarily not patentable. 
[<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/novelty.htm">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/novelty.htm</a>].
</blockquote>

Using the Internet instead of NFS and a markup language instead of shell
scripts or RPM packages, is obvious to practicioners of computer
programming.</FONT><p><h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">6. Avoiding the patent</FONT></h2><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

If the prior art is not sufficient to overturn the patent, then there
are a number of ways to avoid infringing the patent.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Claim 1 refers to an Internet browser being directed to upload the
user's credentials and download the security patches.  This is
a very inefficient way to accomplish this task, especially if it is
to be performed without user intervention.  The overhead of loading
the browser GUI and associated code is much greater than is required.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

It is better for the maintainence program to make a direct HTTP or HTTPS
connection to the server, and to negotiate over this direct connection.
There is no need for the involvement of a full Internet browser.  Thus,
a competing system need only avoid using a browser to contact the server,
and would thereby deliver a superior user experience.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

The patent description attempts to justify this complexity because then
users don't need to understand how to manually install the maintainence
system.  An alternative mechanism that is installed by OEM's on user
computers, or is distributed as part of some standard software package,
would provide the same level of functionality without confusing users.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Some concern has been expressed that this patent covers all manner of
"application service providers" (ASP's).  This concern is based on the
final paragraph of the patent description:

<blockquote>
The foregoing describes a new and useful method and system for
automatically downloading and remotely executing software applications
over a secure Internet connection. Those skilled in the art may make
numerous modifications and departures from the specific embodiments
without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention. For
example, the server computer can comprise a distributed computing
system or a cluster of networked computers; the database may comprise a
distributed database or several databases. Additionally, web pages may
comprise an interface that is not specified herein. Other embodiments may
include a network connection other than the Internet between the
server computer and the user computer; and the software downloaded
may be intended to perform tasks such as database management, word
processing, spread sheet, games, or other tasks that are not specified
herein.
</blockquote>

Since the patent description carries no legal weight, this is just
wishful thinking.  Claims 7 and 11 make it quite clear what type of
maintainence operations are being performed, and the bulk of the
patent description makes no mention of other application types.
ASP's that provide access to ordinary applications will rarely, if ever,
need to perform maintainence tasks.  For example, an online ticket
reservation ASP does not need to access the user's machine to
compress files, scan for viruses, etc.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Even if the description was accepted as legal, it overlaps very
heavily with technologies such as Java that were already deployed
one year prior to the filing date.  One cannot patent the download
of non-maintainence software well after such software was being
widely downloaded and deployed.  This claim has no merit whatsoever.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Claim 9 was a serious oversight.  Payment information is sent via e-mail.
To avoid infringement, competitors can instead use a Web browser or a
direct HTTP or HTTPS connection.  The result is likely to be a better
user experience.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

As claim 1 is vague as to the method for "directing" the user's
machine to download the software package, it is safer to use straightforward
download mechanisms, rather than unnecessarily clever secondary connections.</FONT><p><FONT face="Arial,sans-serif">

Claim 14 is ambiguous as to when the software package is generated.
It may be safer to use methods that package the software ahead of time
rather than on the fly.  However, the example of wu-ftpd demonstrates
that on the fly packaging is obvious.</FONT><p><BR><IMG src="g/FFFFFF.jpg" ALT="" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="20"></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></TD><TD width="129" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" valign="top">
