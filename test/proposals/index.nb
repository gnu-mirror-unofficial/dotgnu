<h2>Welcome!</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DotGNU Steering Committee is pleased to announce that we've begun accepting proposals for software development projects.  The projects that get accepted will make up what DotGNU will become in the future.  Therefore, we've instituted a formal system for proposing software development projects.  
<br><br>
Making a formal proposal as outlined below is a first step in the
direction of allowing your project to become an official part of
DotGNU.  As explained on the <A href="active.html">Active Proposals</A>
page, this will not always happen immediately, and you need not need
to wait for official approval before you can start your project.
<br><br>
<h2>Proposing and Starting a Software Development Project</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Download a simple proposal <a href="proposal-template.txt">form</a>. </li> 
	<li>View a sample proposal: <a href="proposal-structure.txt">proposal-structure.txt</a></li>
	<li>Subscribe to the <a href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/proposals">proposals</a> mailing list proposals@dotgnu.org</li>
	<li>Once you've created a first draft, send it off to the list
	marked as &lt;Original&gt;.  This may start some helpful
	discussions, and it is also the first step towards making your
	project "officially DotGNU".</li>
<LI>You may also want to discuss the proposal on the
<A href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/developers">DotGNU
developers mailing list.</A>
<LI>When you have decided that you want to go forward, create the
project at <A href="http://freesoftware.fsf.org">freesoftware.fsf.org</A>.
If your project has already been made officially part of DotGNU,
answer "yes" to the question of whether you want it to be part of
GNU.  Otherwise, answer "no".  (Answering "yes" before your project is
officially part of DotGNU can result in a long delay before the
project creation request is approved.)
<LI>You are very welcome to use the DotGNU 
<A href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/developers">DotGNU
developers mailing list</A> to report progress with your project, ask
for help, and coordinate with other projects.  For this, it is not
necessary for your project to be "officially DotGNU".  The only
requirements are that the project must be GPL'd Free Software, and
that it should not be totally irrelevant to DotGNU.
</ol>

<h2>Guidelines for Proposing a Software Development Project</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of initial importance is the subject header.  There is a subject header line in the template.  What this points to is the subject header line in the e-mail to the proposals mailing list.  The header should take the following form:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>proposal type</i>-proposal]&lt;<i>stage</i>&gt;<i>proposal-name</i><br>
<br>
An example from the sample proposal:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Subsystem-Proposal]&lt;Original&gt;DotGNU Project-Proposal Structure.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem long, but it tells us some very important information about the proposal.  It tells us the type of proposal, what stage the proposal is in, and the name of the proposal.  The type of proposal will generally, at this point, be a Project-Proposal.  Later, there could be Subsystem-Proposals, Spec-Proposals, etc...  The system is ultimately flexible.  The stage can either be Original, Revised, or Final.  Original is the very first draft that is sent to the list.  Once the draft is modified, it is labelled as Revised.  Once the steering committee has approved the project, the draft is marked Final.  
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to fill in all fields and be sure to mark the version number as an integer.  The version number exists strictly to keep track of which iteration of a proposal a person is reading.  Also, be sure to include a log of you proposal revisions in the revisions section on the template.

<h2>On Being a GNU Maintainer</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepted projects will more than likely become GNU projects.  If you volunteer to be a maintainer, be sure that you've read and have agreed to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain_toc.html">http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain_toc.html</a>.  If you do not agree, then do not volunteer to maintain a package yourself.
