<H1>Active DotGNU Project Proposals</H1>
In this section we list DotGNU Project Proposals which are under
active development, and which we expect to become useful pieces of
Free Software regardless of whether they become "officially" part
of DotGNU.
<P>
We believe that this is the best way for realizing a huge Free
Software project like DotGNU:  The coordinating team must give
capable developers every freedom in creating useful contributions.
It is possible that in some areas we may in the end have the luxury of
choosing between two (or possibly even more) good solutions, but even
then those solutions which don't get chosen to be "officially DotGNU"
will be valuable pieces of Free Software that will work well with
DotGNU.  With Free Software, the true freedom of choice will always be
in the hands of software users, and it will not be inappropriately
influenced by the decisions of the DotGNU Steering Committee
concerning what is, and what isn't "officially DotGNU".

<H2>List of Active Project Proposals</H2>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>FrePort</STRONG><P>
The Freport Project wishes to create a plug-in module for the
<A href="../see.html">Secure Execution Environment daemon (SEE)</A>. The
module will implement secure and private, named data storage and
retrieval and will be useful for authorization, authentication, or
general data storage.  The plug-in will perform many of the functions
of remote open LDAP, with similar functionality to proprietary
solutions such as Microsoft's Passport.
<P>
Unlike other products, primary importance is placed on providing data
and metadata security, user privacy and anonymity, and system
adaptability, while not compromising transportability across devices and
point of access. The Freport system is not a unitary system, but instead
possesses it's own plug-in system designed to adapt the technology to a
variety of data storage mechanisms and networking systems.
<P> 
The project is currently in the architectural development stage.
<P>

<A href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freport-see/">Savannah
project space</A> of this project.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>macs</STRONG><P>
<a href="http://sf.net/projects/macs">macs</a> aims to be a general
purpose authentication, authorization, and user-profiling backend,
frontendable by anything. macsDG will be a DotGNU-specific project to
integrate macs with DotGNU, by creating macs clients, and extending macs
servers, to plug into the <a href="../see.html">Secure Execution
Environment daemon (SEE)</a>. These clients will protect the SEE via the
servers. See the README on the <a href="http://macs.sf.net/">macs page</a>
for an overview. (The SEE could be in the ??? box in the diagram.)
<P>
The plan for the time being is to continue development on a macs
prototype until it is fully featured and functional. At that time, the
macsDG project will begin writing macs clients for the SEE, while the
macs servers are refactored/rewritten. Finally, macsDG will extend the
new (non-prototype) macs servers, adding a compile-time option for making
SEE plugins out of them.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>DotGNU-Jabber Integration</STRONG><P>
The <A href="http://www.theoretic.com/dotgnu">DotGNU-Jabber
Integration Project</A> aims to help DotGNU catch up to 
Microsoft by using Jabber's existing code and user base. Jabber is a 
well-developed 100% open protocol for distributed communications, 
handling such things as real-time messaging, presence, authentication, 
and RPC requests. It has existing servers, modules, and clients that 
are, or could become, GPL'ed. It is already implimented in hundreds of 
independent servers and thousands of clients in a distributed network 
all over the Internet and internal intranets.
<P>
Project leader Adam Theo is also looking for ways how DotGNU can
contribute back to Jabber, especially when it comes to a general
distributed services model.
<P>
This project will begin with how Jabber can provide authentication and 
virtual identity services for DotGNU, and expand to data synchronization 
and subscription/publishing systems.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Cashbox</STRONG><P>
David Nicol, who set up <A href="http://tipjar.com">tipjar.com</A> in
1996, will GPL a catalog/order customer-account system, called "cashbox."
