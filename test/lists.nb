Here is some information on where questions and concerns related to the
mailing lists should be directed:

1. If it's a purely technical issue, contact listadmin@dotgnu.org

2. If it's a policy-related issue, contact coreteam@dotgnu.org

3. If you really feel that the DotGNU core team is not heandling
   things properly, you can try escalating the matter to the
   leadership of FreeDevelopers.  I'm not going to give you an
   email address for that, as it shouldn't be too hard to find
   out who is in charge there with a little research, and these
   good folks are receiving way too much email already.

That would violate RFC1123.  For a detailed discussion see

But it makes it practically impossible to properly continue a
thread that needs to be cross-posted across two mailing lists.
You don't often want to have such threads, but suppose for
example we want to discuss with the Perl6 folks how their work
can be integrated with DotGNU.  That would be a thread that
should properly be cross-posted to both the DotGNU ARCH mailing
list and a mailing list of the Perl6 folks.
 
Greetings, Norbert.
