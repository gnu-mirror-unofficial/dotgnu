title:What about "Web Services"?

<H1>What about "Web Services"?</H1>
Microsoft's concept of "Web Services" is fundamentally flawed because
it requires end-users to transfer their data to the computer systems
of Application Service Providers (ASPs).
<P>
There is nothing wrong with using an Application Service Provider if
you want to, but it is ethically wrong to force computer users to use
ASPs by not giving them the option of running the applications they
want on their own PCs.
<P>
The DotGNU platform solves this problem by allowing the same program
to be run as an application on the end-user's PC or as a "web service"
on computer systems that are provided and maintained by an Application
Service Provider.
<H2>Why DotGNU is better</H2>
There are both ethical and practical reasons why web-based
applications should be implemented on the
<A href="arch.htm">DotGNU platform</A> and not as
pure "web services" like Microsoft wants.
<H3>Ethical reasons</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>End-users must be given the freedom to keep their data
      on their own PCs unless they really want to trust an ASP with
      their data.
  <LI>End-users must be given the freedom to choose any software they
      want for processing their data.  With the .NET initiative,
      Microsoft tries to gain monopoly power that would allow them to
      effectively prevent ASPs from making software available that is
      "not compatible" with Microsoft's licensing terms.  Microsoft's
      efforts in this area seem to be directed in particular against
      Free Software that is licensed under the GNU General Public
      License.
</UL>
<H3>Practical reasons</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>In many situations it is only necessary to access some data from
      a single PC.  In these situations it is obviously better when
      the data and the software which processes it are also located on
      this PC.
  <LI>The DotGNU platform makes it easy for ASPs to set up their
      services in such a way that there is no single point of
      failure.  This is in sharp contrast to Microsoft's concept of
      "web services" where all "web services" rely on Microsoft's
      passport system.  If Microsoft's passport system is temporarily
      not available, then all "web services" which rely on it are also
      not available.
</UL>
<H2>Examples of application programs</H2>
Here are some examples of application programs which should (both for
ethical and for practical reasons) be implemented on the
<A href="arch.htm">DotGNU platform</A>
and not as pure "web services" like Microsoft wants.
<UL>
  <LI> Online identity management.
  <LI> Names, nickname, birthdays, anniversaries, pictures, video clips etc.
  <LI> Address book.
  <LI> Rendez-vous facilities, net meetings, conferencing, gatherings etc.
  <LI> Notifications, alerts management and intelligent routing.
  <LI> Inbox items, interacting seamlessly with existing mail systems,
        voice mail and SMS engines.
  <LI> Project, time and task management.
  <LI> Document storage and virtual "hard drives".
  <LI> Intelligent mirroring of application settings, configuration data.
  <LI> Bookmarks and other Web configuration and identification data.
  <LI> Digital wallet and other transaction records.
  <LI> Device configuration and discovery capabilities.
  <LI> And, of course, reporting, logging, configuration etc. of the
        above services.
</UL>
With DotGNU, these applications do not necessarily need to run as "web
services".  With the <A href="arch.htm">DotGNU platform</A>, the end
user will have the choice of running the same application locally in
an DotGNU Secure Execution Environment on the end user's PC, or over
the internet in an DotGNU Distributed Execution Environment that may
be provided by an Application Service Provider.
<P>
One subproject of the DotGNU project is to provide an application for
<A href="auth.htm">online identity management</A>.  This application
can serve as an example for implementors of other applications for the
DotGNU platform.
