  The DotGNU website
is maintained via Savannah CVS.  So, when someone is willing to
maintain a summary page, please

- register a user ID at http://savannah.gnu.org
- send me an email to let me know about your Savannah user ID
    and what you would like to do.  (I'll try to coordinate
    things to avoid duplication of effort).
