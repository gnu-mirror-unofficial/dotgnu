<h2>
 1. Introduction
</h2>
<p>
 This document is an analysis of the McAfee patent #6,266,774, explaining
 what it does and does not cover.  We hope to dispell the myth that this
 covers all application service providers.
</p>
<p>
 This document was prepared in part to assist the DotGNU project,
 <a href="http://www.dotgnu.org/">http://www.dotgnu.org/</a>, a
 free software initiative under the auspices of the GNU project,
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a> and FreeDevelopers,
 <a href=""></a>.
</p>
<p>
 We concentrate on the claims in the patent, not the description or
 McAfee's press releases.  Only the claims have legal weight.
</p>
<p>
 Nothing in this document should be construed as legal advice.  It is
 an independent review by a computer programmer, not a patent attorney.
</p>
<p>
 If you discover any issues with this document, or other examples of
 prior art, please e-mail the author.

<h2>
 2. Overview of the patent
</h2>
<p>
 The patent was filed on December 8, 1998, and granted July 24, 2001.
 The abstract is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
 A system, method, and computer program product for delivery and automatic
 execution of security, management, or optimization software over an
 Internet connection to a user computer responsive to a user request
 entered via a web browser on the user computer. In a preferred embodiment,
 the user directs the Internet browser to a Internet clinical services
 provider web site computer and logs in to the site using an identifier and
 a secure password and optionally makes a selection of the type of
 servicing desired, wherein an automatically-executing software package
 encapsulated within a markup language communication unit deliverable
 across the Internet is delivered, to the user computer, the
 automatically-executing software package being adapted to perform
 security, management, or optimization functions on the user computer. User
 identifiers and passwords enabling the downloads may be provided on a
 per-download basis or on a subscription basis.
</blockquote>
<p>
 Essentially, the patent covers a system for automatically downloading
 security patches and virus scanner updates over the Internet.  This
 is hardly an earth-shattering achievement: any competent Internet
 programmer could devise such a scheme.  As we will see, the claims
 are obvious to a practicioner of computer programming.
</p>
<h2>
 3. The main claims
</h2>
<p>
 All patents contain two kinds of claims: main and re-statements.  The
 main claims are the core of the patent.  The re-stated claims modify 
 the main claims to cover extensions or variations.  There are three main
 claims in this patent: 1, 12, and 14.
</p>
<blockquote>
 1. A method for automatically performing one or more maintenance tasks on a
 remotely located computer connected to a server computer via a data
 network, said method comprising the steps of:
 <ul>
  <li>
   directing an Internet browser on the remotely located computer to form a
   logical connection with the server computer;
  </li>
  <li>
   delivering a software package to the remotely located computer across said
   logical connection, said software package being encapsulated within a
   markup language communication unit deliverable across said logical
   connection, said software package comprising scripts for performing said
   one or more maintenance tasks on the remotely located computer; and
  </li>
  <li>
   automatically executing the scripts for performing said one or more
   maintenance tasks on the remotely located computer.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This claim describes the software and activities on the &quot;remotely located
 computer&quot;, which is the user's machine.  The machine is directed to connect
 to the server, download a set of maintainence tasks as a &quot;markup communication
 unit&quot;, and execute the maintainence tasks.
</p>
<p>
 Prior art for this isn't hard to find: any system that downloads a shell
 script from a server for automatic execution on a client would be sufficient.
 Unix systems in the early 1990's regularly used the technique of loading
 shell scripts via NFS from a remote server.
</p>
<p>
 More recently, Red Hat Linux systems use RPM files to automatically apply
 security patches consisting of both software updates, and commands to be
 executed.  RPM files can be downloaded by the user with a Web browser,
 or via direct connection to a HTTP server.
</p>
<p>
 Claim 1 attempts to make things different by using an Internet browser and
 a markup language.  But these are just recent incarnations of a very old,
 and obvious, idea.  Namely, administration is more efficient if it can
 be centralised.
</p>
<p>
 This claim is vague as to who or what performs the &quot;directing&quot;.  Is
 it the user themselves?  An automated process installed on user's machine?
 Or the server computer?  The first interpretation is no different than regular
 Web traffic.  The second interpretation is no different than a Unix machine
 using NFS to download a shell script at pre-determined times.
</p>
<p>
 The patent description is also vague, but the third would seem to be
 the most likely interpretation.  That is, the server sends some information
 to the user's Web browser to cause it to accept the download of the software
 package on a secondary connection.
</p>
<p>
 There are two sources of prior art for this: FTP and HTTP redirects.  FTP
 servers negotiate with their clients to set up a secondary connection to
 exchange data files.  HTTP redirects can also be used to force a Web
 browser to visit a secondary Web site that performs data transfer.
</p>
<blockquote>
 12. A computer program product for execution by a server computer for
 enabling the maintenance of a remote user computer coupled to the server
 computer over a network, comprising:
 <ul>
  <li>
   computer code for receiving a user request from the remote user computer,
   said user request being entered by the user via a web browser;
  </li>
  <li>
   computer code for instantiating a download of a maintenance software
   package to a storage medium connected to the user computer via the web
   browser; and
  </li>
  <li>
   computer code for causing said maintenance software to automatically
   execute on the user computer subsequent to downloading;
  </li>
  <li>
   whereby, responsive only to said user-entered request via said web browser,
   advanced maintenance routines may be performed on said user computer
   without requiring local maintenance commands from said user.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This describes the Web server that is providing the service to the user
 machine described in claim 1.  It is obvious that any gadget that conforms
 to the description of claim 1 will need to talk to a gadget that conforms
 to the description of claim 12.  Otherwise the claim 1 gadget cannot
 function successfully.
</p>
<p>
 All known Web servers that existed one year prior to the patent filing
 date provide the above functionality.  The more usual name for the client
 part of the mechanism is &quot;browser plug-ins&quot;, which are activated by
 information supplied by the server upon user request.
</p>
<p>
 If the third interpretation of &quot;directing&quot; in claim 1 is the correct one,
 then existing Web servers provide all of the functionality except the
 establishment of the secondary connection.  Such functionality is more
 common to FTP servers.  The patent has combined the functionality of
 HTTP and FTP in the most obvious manner possible.
</p>
<blockquote>
 14. A computer-readable medium, comprising:
 <ul>
  <li>
   means for directing a server computer to encapsulate a self-executing
   software maintenance program into a markup language communication unit
   deliverable across the Internet;
  </li>
  <li>
   means for directing the server computer to receive a user command over the
   Internet, said user command being received from a user via a web browser
   installed on a remote user computer;
  </li>
  <li>
   means for transmitting said encapsulated self-executing software
   maintenance program to said user remote computer responsive to said user
   command, whereby said software maintenance program is executed responsive
   only to commands entered from the user into the web browser.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This refers to the mechanism used to represent and deliver the software
 updates as the &quot;markup language communication unit&quot;.  Packaging software
 for download is not new: the ZIP format has existed since the early 1990's
 for precisely this purpose.  Incorporating additional script commands is
 also quite common: the shar archive format was doing this in the late 1980's,
 and the RPM format is a more recent example from the mid-1990's.  All of
 these predate the patent filing date by at least a year.
</p>
<p>
 The first part of this claim is vague as to when the unit is generated.
 Is it generated once for all users and stored for download?  If so, then
 claim 14 is precisely the same as ZIP, shar, and RPM in functionality.
</p>
<p>
 Alternatively, the unit may be generated &quot;on the fly&quot; in the server.
 The unit can thus be customized to the specific maintainence tasks
 required by the user's machine.  Previous systems did not normally
 do this, because it is inefficient.  However, if an administrator of
 a previous system wanted to build such a system, it would be quite
 obvious how to do so.  Packaging software is fully automatable and
 configurable.
</p>
<p>
 There is some prior art for packaging software &quot;on the fly&quot; in a
 server.  The wu-ftpd FTP server can automatically package the contents
 of a directory as a &quot;tar&quot; file for download to a user's machine.
 Because the server does not know ahead of time which directories the
 user may wish to download, it must perform the task upon request.
</p>
<h2>
 4. Restating the obvious
</h2>
<p>
 With any system that uses the Internet, there are various practical
 considerations that must be taken into account: security, transaction
 logging, dynamic notification, etc.  Claims 2 through 11, and 13 enumerate
 these, just in case the reader was unable to figure them out
 for themselves.
</p>
<blockquote>
 2. The method of claim 1, said step of directing including a registering
 step, said registering step comprising the steps of:
 <ul>
  <li>
   downloading a web page located on the server computer using the Internet
   browser;
  </li>
  <li>
   entering an identifier and a secure password on said web page; and
  </li>
  <li>
   selecting an option presented on the web page to send the identifier and
   password to the server computer;
  </li>
  <li>
   wherein said step of delivering the software package is enabled only if a
   user has provided a valid identifier and password.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This claim adds an extra Web page to the start of the process, to allow the
 user to login to the server that supplies the security updates.  Since
 the server is providing security updates for particular machines, some way
 is needed to identify those machines.  A username/password scheme is an
 obvious way of achieving this, if not a particularly secure one.
</p>
<blockquote>
 3. The method of claim 2, further comprising the steps of:
 <ul>
  <li>
   creating a transaction log on the server computer; and
  </li>
  <li>
   recording information related to said steps of registering and delivering
   in the said transaction log.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This claim says that the server records every security update transaction
 in a log of some kind.  Since Web servers normally keep logs of every request
 anyway, this claim is just restating the normal functions of a Web server.
</p>
<p>
 We will note here that keeping logs of every update made to a machine is
 probably a violation of the user's privacy.
</p>
<blockquote>
 4. The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of generating a
 periodic activity report for the remotely located computer.
</blockquote>
<p>
 To compound the privacy concerns, this claim says that the server has
 some mechanism to summarise the activities of the user.  In any case,
 it is a normal function of Web servers to provide some way to summarise
 the logs according to various criteria.
</p>
<p>
 However, this analysis may be incorrect.  Perhaps claim 4 does not refer
 to summarising the user's activity for the server administrators.  It may
 refer to summarising the activity for the user themselves to view.  It is
 fairly obvious that a way to summarise activity for the administrator can
 be trivially turned into a way for the user to access the same information.
</p>
<blockquote>
 5. The method of claim 4, further comprising the step of transmitting an
 electronic message in an e-mail format from the server computer to the
 remotely located computer indicating that a new product or a new
 application is available for download.
</blockquote>
<p>
 It is quite common for Web sites to automatically e-mail registered
 users about updates or new offerings.  This claim is not adding
 anything new.
</p>
<blockquote>
 6. The method of claim 5, said logical connection with the server computer
 being a secure network connection.
</blockquote>
<p>
 This claim says that the patent still holds if the information is sent
 over a secure connection.  That is, the user accesses the server and
 downloads the software package using SSL rather than a raw connection.
 It is obvious to anyone familiar with Internet protocols that any information
 that is sent via an insecure channel can also be sent by a secure channel.
</p>
<blockquote>
 7. The method of claim 6, said software package including a program to
 detect computer viruses on the remotely located computer.
</blockquote>
<p>
 Previous claims have left it fairly open as to the type of software
 that was being transferred, except to say that the software is
 performing maintainence operations.  Should the previous claims be
 found to be too broad, then this claim is engaged to say that the
 particular case of virus scanning programs is still covered.
</p>
<p>
 This claim is really what the patent is all about: automatic downloading
 of virus scanners and updates.  Thus, vendors of virus scanning software
 may have something to fear from this patent, but few other companies will.
</p>
<p>
 We will state though that it is pretty obvious that the Internet can
 be used to distribute programs and program updates of any kind.  This has
 been one of its primary functions since its earliest days.  Virus scanners and
 updates are no different to any other kind of software in this regard.
</p>
<blockquote>
 8. The method of claim 2, further comprising the steps of:
 <ul>
  <li>
   before or during registering the remotely located computer, creating an
   account for a user of the remotely located computer on the server
   computer; and
  </li>
  <li>
   identifying said identifier and password as valid if the user has a current
   subscription or a positive fund balance in said user account.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The first part of this claim says that an account should be automatically
 created for new users.  This is a common feature of most Web sites that
 require user registration.
</p>
<p>
 The second part of this claim says that the user should only be authorised
 by the login mechanism if they are properly subscribed and if sufficient
 funds are available in their personal account.  The fundamental requirement
 of e-commerce, that no service shall be supplied without payment, makes
 it pretty obvious that such a check needs to be performed at some point.
</p>
<blockquote>
 9. The method of claim 8, further comprising the step of transmitting
 payment information from the remotely located computer to the server
 computer in an electronic mail message format, wherein said account may
 reflect a current subscription or an increased fund balance upon receipt
 of said payment information.
</blockquote>
<p>
 This claim says that payment information may be sent to the server in
 an e-mail message.  Presumably this information would include credit
 card details, or some other form of payment.  Obviously, some means
 is needed to communicate to the server how payment should be achieved.
</p>
<p>
 Interestingly, the patent only mentions sending payment information
 via e-mail, and not by direct entry on a Web page.  This oversight makes
 it very easy for competitors to avoid infringing this aspect of the patent.
 They need only require their users to access a Web page to provide payment
 information.  Since Web pages are easier to secure using SSL than e-mail,
 this will result in a better system for the users.
</p>
<blockquote>
 10. The method of claim 9, further comprising the steps of:
 <ul>
  <li>
   generating an electronic receipt on the server computer; and
  </li>
  <li>
   transmitting the receipt to the remotely located computer.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This claims says that a receipt is generated and transmitted after the payment
 information is supplied.  This is an obvious requirement for any e-commerce
 system.
</p>
<blockquote>
 11. The method of claim 1 wherein said one or more maintenance tasks
 comprise at least one of the following: compression of software,
 compression of data, search for software that needs to be upgraded, search
 for data that needs to be upgraded, upgrade of software, upgrade of data,
 search for obsolete software, search for obsolete data, deletion of
 obsolete software, deletion of obsolete data, archival of software,
 archival of data, hardware diagnostics, and software diagnostics.
</blockquote>
<p>
 This claim attempts to enumerate all of the tasks that may need to be
 performed during software maintainence.  This list is hardly surprising:
 every system administrator since the dawn of computing has performed
 these tasks, or written automated scripts to perform the tasks for them.
</p>
<blockquote>
 13. The computer program product of claim 12, further comprising computer
 code for receiving payment or subscription information from the user,
 whereby said maintenance software package is downloaded to the user
 computer only upon receiving valid payment information or current
 subscription information from the user.
</blockquote>
<p>
 This modifies claim 12 to include the ability to process the user's
 payment or subscription information.  This is an obvious requirement
 for communicating with any client that conforms to claim 8.
</p>
<h2>
 5. Prior art
</h2>
<p>
 Symantec's HealthyPC program may be sufficient prior art.  The
 following is from a CNET news article, dated April 28, 1997:
</p>
<blockquote>
 During the quarter, Symantec and ZDNet launched HealthyPC.com, a Web site
 that emphasizes PC maintenance. It offers two separate services: a free
 advice and consultation area maintained by ZDNet and a subscription-based
 service with access to Symantec's antivirus, utility, and LiveUpdate software.
 [<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-318512.html">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-318512.html</a>].
</blockquote>
<p>
 If HealthyPC is not sufficient prior art, then any Unix machine from the
 early 1990's that downloaded a shell script via NFS and executed it should
 be sufficient.  RPM is also sufficient, and is even closer to the
 patent than shell/NFS.  Automatic shell script download and execution is
 basically all this patent is about: the technologies have changed slightly,
 but the concept is identical.  The USPTO guidelines on this are quite
 clear:
</p>
<blockquote>
 Even if the subject matter sought to be patented is not exactly shown
 by the prior art, and involves one or more differences over the
 most nearly similar thing already known, a patent may still be refused
 if the differences would be obvious. The subject matter sought to
 be patented must be sufficiently different from what has been used
 or described before that it may be said to be nonobvious to a person
 having ordinary skill in the area of technology related to the invention.
 For example, the substitution of one material for another, or
 changes in size, are ordinarily not patentable. 
 [<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/novelty.htm">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/novelty.htm</a>].
</blockquote>
<p>
 Using the Internet instead of NFS and a markup language instead of shell
 scripts or RPM packages, is obvious to practicioners of computer
 programming.
</p>
<h2>
 6. Avoiding the patent
</h2>
<p>
 If the prior art is not sufficient to overturn the patent, then there
 are a number of ways to avoid infringing the patent.
</p>
<p>
 Claim 1 refers to an Internet browser being directed to upload the
 user's credentials and download the security patches.  This is
 a very inefficient way to accomplish this task, especially if it is
 to be performed without user intervention.  The overhead of loading
 the browser GUI and associated code is much greater than is required.
</p>
<p>
 It is better for the maintainence program to make a direct HTTP or HTTPS
 connection to the server, and to negotiate over this direct connection.
 There is no need for the involvement of a full Internet browser.  Thus,
 a competing system need only avoid using a browser to contact the server,
 and would thereby deliver a superior user experience.
</p>
<p>
 The patent description attempts to justify this complexity because then
 users don't need to understand how to manually install the maintainence
 system.  An alternative mechanism that is installed by OEM's on user
 computers, or is distributed as part of some standard software package,
 would provide the same level of functionality without confusing users.
</p>
<p>
 Some concern has been expressed that this patent covers all manner of
 &quot;application service providers&quot; (ASP's).  This concern is based on the
 final paragraph of the patent description:
</p>
<blockquote>
 The foregoing describes a new and useful method and system for
 automatically downloading and remotely executing software applications
 over a secure Internet connection. Those skilled in the art may make
 numerous modifications and departures from the specific embodiments
 without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention. For
 example, the server computer can comprise a distributed computing
 system or a cluster of networked computers; the database may comprise a
 distributed database or several databases. Additionally, web pages may
 comprise an interface that is not specified herein. Other embodiments may
 include a network connection other than the Internet between the
 server computer and the user computer; and the software downloaded
 may be intended to perform tasks such as database management, word
 processing, spread sheet, games, or other tasks that are not specified
 herein.
</blockquote>
<p>
 Since the patent description carries no legal weight, this is just
 wishful thinking.  Claims 7 and 11 make it quite clear what type of
 maintainence operations are being performed, and the bulk of the
 patent description makes no mention of other application types.
 ASP's that provide access to ordinary applications will rarely, if ever,
 need to perform maintainence tasks.  For example, an online ticket
 reservation ASP does not need to access the user's machine to
 compress files, scan for viruses, etc.
</p>
<p>
 Even if the description was accepted as legal, it overlaps very
 heavily with technologies such as Java that were already deployed
 one year prior to the filing date.  One cannot patent the download
 of non-maintainence software well after such software was being
 widely downloaded and deployed.  This claim has no merit whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
 Claim 9 was a serious oversight.  Payment information is sent via e-mail.
 To avoid infringement, competitors can instead use a Web browser or a
 direct HTTP or HTTPS connection.  The result is likely to be a better
 user experience.
</p>
<p>
 As claim 1 is vague as to the method for &quot;directing&quot; the user's
 machine to download the software package, it is safer to use straightforward
 download mechanisms, rather than unnecessarily clever secondary connections.
</p>
<p>
 Claim 14 is ambiguous as to when the software package is generated.
 It may be safer to use methods that package the software ahead of time
 rather than on the fly.  However, the example of wu-ftpd demonstrates
 that on the fly packaging is obvious.
