<h2>DotGNU SEE: Secure Execution Environment</h2>

<!--
<h4>Update for our previous readers</h4>

<p>As progress on Pnet has accelerated, and progress on the SEE has stagnated,
the SEE's purpose has been redefined. We are reemphasizing the 'daemon' role
of the SEE.</p>

<p>The original definition of the SEE called for something that matched its
name: an environment for bytecode programs to execute in. Due to
efficiency considerations, however, the SEE has become a much simpler
matter. While this will make it harder to create plugins, it will improve
the reliability of SEE, which is considered extremely important, due to
its daemon nature.</p>
-->

<h3>What is SEE's place in DotGNU?</h3>

<p>If Portable.net and related &quot;plugins&quot; are designed to execute
bytecode programs (such as .NET/IL and Java), then the SEE gives them
something to execute. In fact, when you want to start a program in
DotGNU, you will tell SEE that you want to execute it.</p>

<h3>Why do we need a SEE ?</h3> 
<p>
This is a fairly relevant question in context. <i> why not use the 
plugins directly ?</i> .The DotGNU project
does not want to be locked in to a specific vendor, such as Microsoft
or Sun, in the event that such a company is able to force DotGNU to
stop work on support for its respective format.</p>

<p>However, politics is not the only consideration. DotGNU wants to
provide a replacement for .NET that fixes some of the problems in
Microsoft's model, and that includes security issues. The SEE can
execute code from anywhere!  However, it must decide whether or not to
trust that code.</p>

<h4>Do you trust your programs?</h4>

<p>If you ever download a program and run it on your machine, you are
<i>trusting</i> that program. That means that you trust the provider
of that program. If you go to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/">GNU site</a>, or <a href="http://www.kde.org/">kde.org</a>, you likely trust that programs
you download from those locations are not virus-ridden. But if you
visit a random site on a free hosting service, you may doubt the
safety of running that program. In particular, you are not able to
verify the identity of that provider.</p>

<p>SEE helps fix that problem with code verification. Using encryption
technology, SEE will be able to verify the identity of the provider
and thus help you to then decide whether or not to trust that
program.</p>

<h4>The Daemon</h4>

<p>The SEE will run on a user's computer all the time, even while they
are using other programs. When a user wants to execute a program, the
SEE will take over. It will get the program, wherever it is, decide
whether or not to trust it, and then pass it to an appropriate plugin
for execution. This is not very much work (with the possible exception
of identity verification), but far too important to be left to the
plugins. If this job is left to the plugins, we cannot be sure whether
each plugin will do the job right. However, in this model, if there is
a bug in what the SEE does, it need only be fixed in one place.</p>

<p>Also, there is the issue of trusting plugins. If each plugin
manages identity by itself, then you are on your own when choosing to
trust a new plugin. However, SEE can verify plugins, as well as code
for them to execute.</p>

<h4>Thin Client/Server</h4>

<p>SEE is not a 'do-everything' program. To have programs execute
&quot;inside&quot; the SEE, as the name seems to imply, would require
a great deal of overhead during execution, in terms of both processing
power and memory.  Businesses cannot afford to waste precious clock
cycles on a monolithic, generic wrapper for general-purpose software,
and end-customers would certainly have no patience. Thanks to the
belated arrival of decent amounts of RAM, many users are just now
beginning to take advantage of the full power of multitasking
available in modern operating systems. They expect that programs will
be able to operate on their fair shares of CPU and RAM. They also
expect this will all be done with the same efficiency as 'legacy'
machine-code programs.  (While this is an almost-impossible
expectation <i>technically</i>, it is not unreasonable in appearances,
as users cannot detect the execution time of a single printf(). This
is a goal of DotGNU, and will be accomplished, barring bad design of
applications on the framework.)</p>

<p>While the ability of the plugins to meet these requirements is, of
course, outside the area of SEE design, SEE does everything it can do
to stay out of the way, as any good daemon should do. The SEE is
simple, performing no apparent CPU-intensive tasks, and maintains a
low memory footprint by relying heavily on shared libraries providing
services to all running plugins. This allows plugins to contact SEE as
necessary, without requiring heavyweight measures such as routing
network communication through SEE. The benefits of this model increase
exponentially in a multi-user, multitasking environment.</p>

<h3>What does it do now ?</h3>

<p>I believe some progress has been made at
irc.openprojects.net#dotgnu on this topic. The result is the above
definition of the SEE. However, the following information would be
more of interest to those interested in helping out with the SEE.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:nb@cisto.com">Norbert Bollow</a> provided the
developers mailing list with a concise description of what the SEE is
supposed to do, code-wise, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The SEE daemon should probably be little more than a slightly fancy
inetd which is capable of handling three types of requests:</p>

<p> (a) user connects to run a program on the server<br />
 (b) user connects to download a program to their machine<br />
 (c) server connects to run a program on the user's machine</p>

<p>and which does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Examine a &quot;portable executable&quot; and determine what VM is
   suitable for this.</li>

<li>Call the auth system which determines whether it's ok to run this
   code.</li>

<li>Depending on some configuration file, determine whether an alarm
   should be raised or not.  Raise the alarm if necessary.</li>

<li>If the auth system said that it's ok to run this code, fork-exec
   the appropriate VM.  Otherwise print an error message and close
   the connection.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>The original message can be found <a href="http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2001-December/001542.html">here.</a></i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Simple enough, eh? With the exception of the auth connection, which
is still an unknown factor, this all looks quite manageable.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As for auth, this will most likely be
provided by one of the shared libraries mentioned earlier, and may
even be implemented by the auth project, rather than
dotgnu-see. Thanks to Barry Fitzgerald for this information!</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>SEE is being developed in conjunction with <a href="http://nongnu.org/VRS">VRS</a>, its complementary project, as
well as common framework packages <a href="http://www.nfluid.com/prodgw.html">Goldwater</a> for the
network-centric inter-process communication and <a href="http://www.nfluid.com/dgee/dgee.html">DotGNU Execution
Environment</a> for common functionality between VRS and SEE.</p>

<p>Get in touch with the developers at <a href="http://mail.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/vrs-development">the
vrs-development mailing list</a> or the DotGNU developers list if
you'd like to help out.  We're still in the very early coding
stage.</p>

<p>You can see a specification of the DotGNU Execution Environment at
the preceding link, and a simpler <a href="http://csserver.evansville.edu/~sc87/see-arch.txt">SEE-specific
document</a> as well.</p>
