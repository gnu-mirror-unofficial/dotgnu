<H1>The DotGNU Project</H1>
The DotGNU Project is really a meta-project that will consist of
between ten and twenty software development projects.  Do you agree
with us that the Free Software world needs to develop a strong
response to Microsoft's .NET initiative?  Then please visit our
<a href="projects.htm">projects page</a> and choose a project to which
you would like to contribute.
<H2>General Information about the DotGNU Project</H2>
DotGNU is a project of
<A href="http://freedevelopers.net">FreeDevelopers.net</A>
and it is endorsed by the
<A href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</A>.
The DotGNU system will be a well-integrated part of the
<A href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU system</A>
and it will also be made available to the users of all other
widely-used operation systems.  If you wish to receive important
announcements about the DotGNU project, please subscribe to the
<A href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">
   DotGNU announcements mailing list</A>. 
<H3>Where will DotGNU compete with the Microsoft .Net
    and Hailstorm products?</H3>
In all areas.
<P>
Just like it's the goal of the <A href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</A>
to create a complete operating system that makes it completely
unnecessary to use a non-free operating system like e.g. Microsoft
Windows, it's the goal of the DotGNU project to be a complete
competitor to Microsoft's ".Net initiative" and "Hailstorm" products.
<P>
The DotGNU project will compete with Microsoft for end-users,
business customers and developers.
<P>
Microsoft Windows had a huge head start over GNU/Linux in terms
of user-friendliness to end users.  In spite of Microsoft's vast
resources, GNU/Linux is already better than Microsoft Windows in
some areas, and catching up fast in most others.
<P>
We believe that the same kind of success story is possible with
the DotGNU project.  The main difference is that this time,
Microsoft doesn't have such a big head start.
<H3>What will DotGNU do that those products also want to do?</H3>
The DotGNU system will deliver the same and better benefits to end
users and business customers, but we will be very careful that no
company or other organization can gain any monopoly-like power over
the system.
<H3>How will DotGNU be different from those Microsoft products?</H3>
The DotGNU project will use good ideas from Microsoft as a
source of inspiration, and Microsoft will probably also use
good ideas from the DotGNU project as a source of inspiration.
<P>
The big difference is that there is a single company (Microsoft)
in the center of the universe of the ".Net initiative" and
"Hailstorm" products,  while the DotGNU project creates a
framework where anyone who wants can offer every service.
For example, with DotGNU every Internet Service Provider (ISP)
can offer the equivalent of Microsoft's "Passport" service,
and the ISP can customize and modify this service according to
their customers' needs.
<H3>How did the DotGNU project get started, and where is it at in
    terms of producing a usable product?</H3>
The project has started out of concern that Microsoft could
possibly obtain an effective monopoly on some aspects of
internet commerce.  No programming work that is specific to
the DotGNU project has been done yet, but in many areas there is
some high-quality Free Software already that can be adapted to
meet the needs of the DotGNU project.
<P>
There is an intensive discussion of basic strategic and design
issues right now on the
<A href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/developers">
   DotGNU developers mailing list</A>.
<P>
Right now is an excellent opportunity for every programmer /
software developer who cares about matters of Freedom to get
involved right from the beginning in a truly important project.
<H3>What do you guys think of Microsoft's .Net and Hailstorm efforts?</H3>
Dangerous stuff.  It is often said that the price of freedom is
eternal vigilance.  Unless we counter them, Microsoft's efforts
are not only a threat to Free Software, they are also extremely
dangerous tools in the hands of any Evil Government that wants
to make their citizens unfree.
