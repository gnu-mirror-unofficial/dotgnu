<h1>DotGNU Portable.NET</h1>
<p>
The goal of this project is to build a suite of free software tools to build
and execute .NET applications, including a C# compiler, assembler,
disassembler, and runtime engine. While the initial target platform was
GNU/Linux, it is also known to run under MS Windows, Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and MacOS X. The runtime engine has been tested on the x86, PowerPC,
ARM, Sparc, PARISC, s309, Alpha, and IA-64 processors.
</p>
<h2>Focus on Compatibility</h2>
<p>
DotGNU Portable.NET is focused on compatibility with the ECMA specifications
for CLI. There are other projects under the DotGNU meta-project to build other
necessary pieces of infrastructure, and to explore non-CLI approaches to
virtual machine implementation.
</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>
Please refer to the
<A href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/pnet_faq.html">FAQ of the
Portable.Net development project</A>.
</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
Released versions are available from the <a href="downloads.html">downloads
page</a>.  It may however be best to grab the latest development version
from <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group_id=353">Savannah CVS</a>.
This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous (pserver)
CVS with the following instruction set.  When prompted for a password for
anoncvs, simply press the Enter key.
<pre>
  cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/dotgnu-pnet login

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/dotgnu-pnet co .
</pre>
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Before you can build the cvs version, you need to run
<code>auto_gen.sh</code> in order to create the Makefile.in and
configure files.
</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>
The three primary components of the system must be built in the
following order: <code>treecc</code>, <code>pnet</code>, and then
<code>pnetlib</code>.
</p>
<p>
You will need flex and bison to build DotGNU Portable.NET.  We use
flex 2.5.4 and bison 1.28.  Some support is provided for the BSD
version of yacc, but bison is recommended.  Other versions of lex
or yacc may not work.
</p>
<p>
Each source package can be unpacked, built, and installed in the usual manner:

	<blockquote>

	<code>$ zcat &lt;package-version.tar.gz | tar xvf -<br/>
	$ cd package-version<br/>
	$ ./configure<br/>
	$ make<br/>
	$ make install</code>
	</blockquote>
</p>
<h2>Running the examples</h2>
<p>
Once you have built the system, you can test it on the examples within
the "<code>samples</code>" directory:
</p>
	<blockquote>
	<code>$ cd samples<br/>
	$ ../engine/ilrun hello.exe<br/>
	$ ../engine/ilrun fib.exe</code>
	</blockquote>
<p>
The PNetMark program, listed above, is a more involved example.
Instructions for running PNetMark can be found within its
<code>README</code> file.
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
Online documentation for the tools can be found
<a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/docs/pnettools_toc.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Information on changes to individual versions can be found in the
<code>NEWS</code> file within the distribution.
</p>
<p>
The Converted Virtual Machine (CVM) instruction set has been documented
using embedded XML tags in the source.  A HTML version of the documentation
can be found <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/doc/cvm/index.html">here</a>.

<h2>Latest Changes</h2>
<p>
6 September 2003:
<blockquote>
    Version 0.5.12 of pnet, pnetlib, pnetC, and ml-pnet have been released.
</blockquote></p><p>
26 July 2003:

<blockquote>
Version 0.5.10 of <code>pnet</code>, <code>pnetlib</code>,
<code>pnetC</code>, and <code>ml-pnet</code> have been released.

A lot has happened this release.  The <code>System.Windows.Forms</code>
namespace is coming along well, thanks to the help of many people in
the DotGNU community - particularly Simon Guindon, Neil Cawse, Richard
Baumann, Ian Fung, Cecilio Pardo, and the relentless Gopal V.

The C compiler is now working enough to allow people to write real C
applications.  We need assistance on the <code>pnetC</code> library,
to port <code>glibc</code> across to run in the Portable.NET environment.

Thong Nguyen has been working very hard on threading this month, and
has achieved a lot!  Threading is now working quite well - help with
testing on various platforms would be appreciated.

Richard Baumann has also been working on <code>System.Reflection.Emit</code>,
and is making good progress.

The CVM unroller was also rewritten into a generic framework that should
be much easier to port to new architectures.

For more information, see the <code>NEWS</code> files.
</blockquote></p><p>

17 July 2003:

<blockquote>

Version 0.2.6 of <code>treecc</code> has been released.  Minor feature
additions that don't affect Portable.NET, but may affect other users.
</blockquote></p><p>

17 June 2003:

<blockquote>
Version 0.5.8 of <code>pnet</code>, <code>pnetlib</code>,
<code>pnetC</code>, and <code>ml-pnet</code> have been released.

A lot of things have happened this cycle.  The Java and Visual Basic
language front-ends for <code>cscc</code> have been added to the system,
and a huge number of new classes have been implemented in pnetlib,
including support for IPv6 and IrDA networking.

We have also begun implementation of the <code>System.Windows.Forms</code>
library, built on top of the X11 library.  This means that it will be
able to run on any X11-capable system.  Currently tested to work on
x86-based GNU/Linux systems and ppc-based MacOS X systems.

We are looking for volunteers to help us implement the
"<code>x11-winforms</code>" library as quickly as possible,
and to test it on as many platforms as possible.

Finally, the <code>ml-pnet</code> project has been started to provide
ports of certain <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a> C# libraries.
<code>System.Data</code> (ADO.NET) currently works, and we hope to have
<code>System.Web</code> (ASP.NET) working soon.
</blockquote></p><p>

3 May 2003:

<blockquote>
Version 0.5.6 of <code>pnet</code>, <code>pnetlib</code>, and
<code>pnetC</code> have been released.

The two big changes this release are the signature-compatibility of
pnetlib (described below), and improved support for stripped-down
profiles for embedded systems.
</blockquote></p><p>

26 April 2003:

<blockquote>

The CVS version of <code>pnetlib</code>'s <code>mscorlib.dll</code> is
now 100% signature-compatible with the .NET Framework SDK.  Read the
full announcement on the DotGNU developer's mailing list
<a href="http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-April/010460.html">here</a>.
</blockquote></p><p>

1 April 2003:

<blockquote>
A small patch for version 0.5.4 <code>pnet</code> has been
<a href="download/pnet-0.5.4-1.patch">released</a>.  It applies to
all platforms except MacOSX, and fixes a problem when trying to compile

<code>pnetC</code>.  If you don't need to use the C compiler,
this patch should not affect you.
</blockquote></p><p>

29 March 2003:

<blockquote>
Version 0.5.4 of <code>pnet</code>, <code>pnetlib</code>, and
<code>pnetC</code>, and version 0.2.4 of <code>treecc</code> have
been released.
</blockquote></p><p>

12 February 2003:

<blockquote>
Version 0.0.6 of <code>pnetmark</code> has been released.  This version
adds the SciMark and Linpack floating-point benchmarks, plus better
support for building and running with other CLI implementations.
</blockquote></p><p>

8 February 2003:

<blockquote>
Version 0.5.2 of <code>pnet</code> and <code>pnetlib</code>, and
version 0.2.2 of <code>treecc</code> have been released.

This is mostly a cleanup and portability release.  Portable.NET is now known
to run on i386, PowerPC, ia64, alpha, PA-RISC, sparc, arm, and s390 systems.
</blockquote></p><p>

16 January 2003:

<blockquote>
I wrote a simple Mahjongg tile game for Portable.NET and
<a href="http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net/">Qt# 0.6</a>.
You can download the sources for the game
<a href="download/mahjongg-0.0.1.tar.gz">here</a>.  It's very simple
at the moment.  Feel free to send me patches to improve the gameplay,
add loadable tilesets, scoring, or any other cool feature that
you can think of.  Adam Treat was kind enough to provide a
<a href="http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net/screen/mahjongg-0.6.png">screenshot</a>.
</blockquote></p><p>

11 January 2003:

<blockquote>

Version 0.5.0 of <code>pnet</code>, <code>pnetlib</code>, and
<code>pnetC</code> have been released.  This is the most stable version
of the compiler, runtime, and libraries to date.

Version 0.2.0 of <code>treecc</code>, version 0.0.4 of <code>pnetmark</code>,
and version 0.0.2 of <code>pnetcurses</code> have also been updated.

</blockquote></p><p>

23 November 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.4.8 of <code>pnet</code>, version 0.4.8 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
and version 0.1.8 of <code>treecc</code> have been released.

The version numbers of <code>pnet</code> and <code>pnetlib</code> have
been synchronized because they are always released together.

The biggest news for this release is that <code>cscc</code> can now
cleanly compile <code>pnetlib</code>, and the pre-built binaries in
<code>pnet/samples</code> are produced with <code>cscc</code>.

We are now independent of third party C# tools, and it should be a
lot easier to help out on the C# library.  Please help us if you
can by writing C# classes or test cases.
</blockquote></p><p>

22 November 2002:

<blockquote>
The <a href="pnet_faq.html">FAQ</a> has been updated with a lot more
information on installing and using Portable.NET, the C compiler,
and how to contribute.
</blockquote></p><p>

5 November 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.4.6 of <code>pnet</code>, version 0.3.0 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
and version 0.1.6 of <code>treecc</code> have been released.

It is now possible to compile <code>pnetlib</code> using <code>pnet</code>,
but that is no guarantee that it will run just yet.  All help will be
appreciated in helping track down the remaining compiler bugs.
</blockquote></p><p>

2 September 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.4.4 of <code>pnet</code>, version 0.2.8 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
version 0.0.2 of <code>pnetC</code>, and version 0.1.4 of <code>treecc</code>

have been released.

The biggest change to this release is the introduction of a C compiler
front-end for <code>cscc</code>.  When combined with the <code>pnetC</code>
C library, this can be used to build C applications to run on CLR
platforms such as <code>pnet</code> as pure IL bytecode.
</blockquote></p><p>

25 July 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.4.2 of <code>pnet</code> and version 0.2.6 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
have been released.

</blockquote></p><p>

17 July 2002:

<blockquote>
There have been some DNS problems with the <code>dotgnu.org</code>
domain recently.  The <code>dotgnu.info</code> domain can be used
as a back up until we can resolve these issues.
</blockquote></p><p>

4 July 2002:

<blockquote>
Portable.NET can now be used with
<a href="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">Gtk#</a>!  A screenshot can be
found <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/download/pnetgtk.png">here</a>.
You will need the CVS version of <code>pnet</code> to use Gtk#, not
version 0.4.0.  See the file <code>pnet/doc/gtk-sharp.HOWTO</code> for
more information.

</blockquote></p><p>

27 June 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.4.0 of <code>pnet</code>, version 0.2.4 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
version 0.0.3 of <code>pnetmark</code>, and version 0.1.2 of
<code>treecc</code> have been released.
</blockquote></p><p>

12 June 2002:


<blockquote>
We have uploaded a description of how Portable.NET can be used in
embedded environments <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/doc/embedded.html">here</a>.

The process of making Portable.NET embedded-compatible is still ongoing.
Check the CVS version for the latest information.
</blockquote></p><p>

10 June 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.3.8 of <code>pnet</code> and version 0.2.2 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
have been released.  The bulk of the changes are to runtime engine
performance, and portability to MacOSX.  See the NEWS file for other changes.

</blockquote></p><p>

11 May 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.3.6 of <code>pnet</code> and version 0.2.0 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
have been released.  The bulk of the changes are to the runtime engine and
the C# compiler.

Version 0.0.2 of <code>pnetmark</code> has also been released.  See the
<a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/doc/pm_faq.html">PNetMark FAQ</a>

for more information.
</blockquote></p><p>

20 April 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.3.4 of <code>pnet</code>, version 0.1.8 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
and version 0.1.0 of <code>treecc</code> have been released.  Many changes
to the runtime engine and pnetlib.  The runtime engine has a new method
caching policy and many bug fixes.  Pnetlib has extensive support
for internationalization (I18N) routines in separate plug-in assemblies.

Some of the annoying automake 1.5 problems under Cygwin should now be
fixed in the <code>.tar.gz</code> release versions (the CVS version may
still be problematic with automake 1.5).

</blockquote></p><p>

8 April 2002:

<blockquote>
The Converted Virtual Machine (CVM) instruction set has been documented
using embedded XML tags in the source.  A HTML version of the documentation
can be found <a href="doc/cvm/index.html">here</a>.  Many thanks for
Gopal V. for building the Python script for converting the XML into HTML.
</blockquote></p><p>

27 March 2002:

<blockquote>
Version 0.3.2 of <code>pnet</code>, version 0.1.6 of <code>pnetlib</code>,
and version 0.0.8 of <code>treecc</code> have been released.  The biggest
change is to the C# compiler, which can now compile the metadata in

<code>pnetlib</code> (metadata consists of the class, field, and method
definitions, but not the method bodies).  The library, pnetlib, is also
moving forward with many changes to the "System" assembly, including
network code.
</blockquote></p><p>

20 March 2002:

<blockquote>
Daily CVS snapshots of the source code are now available from
<a href="http://snapshots.dotgnu.info/dotgnu-pnet/">http://snapshots.dotgnu.info/dotgnu-pnet/</a>.

</blockquote></p><p>

8 March 2002:

<blockquote>
Treecc has been published!  There is an article in

<a href="http://www.rons.net.cn/english/FSM/issue02">Issue 2</a>
of Free Software Magazine.  The article describes the common problems
with compiler implementation and how the aspect-oriented foundation of
treecc helps solve these problems.  A HTML copy of the article
can be found <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/treecc_essay.html">here</a>.
</blockquote></p><p>

11 February 2002:

<blockquote>
Released <code>pnet</code> version 0.3.0 and <code>pnetlib</code>
version 0.1.4.  The major changes are to the C# compiler.
</blockquote></p><p>

28 January 2002:

<blockquote>
We've been getting many requests lately as to how people can help
make DotGNU Portable.NET successful.  The most urgent area is the
C# class library.  See the pnetlib <a href="pnetlib_HACKING.txt">HACKING</a>
file for details of where to start.
</blockquote></p><p>

11 January 2002:

<blockquote>
The <code>cscctest</code> module has been added to the CVS server
on Savannah.  It contains a regression test suite for Portable.NET's
<code>cscc</code> compiler.

</blockquote></p><p>

10 January 2002:

<blockquote>
To help organise things better, bug reports should be submitted via the
Tech Support Manager on Savannah:
	<blockquote>
	<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group_id=353">http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group_id=353</a>
	</blockquote>

<code>pnetlib</code> source code in CVS to assist in the process
of building patch files to upload to Savannah.
</blockquote></p><p>

7 January 2002:

<blockquote>
Released <code>pnet</code> version 0.2.8 and <code>pnetlib</code>

version 0.1.2.  The major changes are to the C# library and its
dependencies in <code>pnet</code>.

all of the outstanding tasks.  It can be found on the DotGNU Web site:
<a href="http://www.dotgnu.org/pnetlib-status/">http://www.dotgnu.org/pnetlib-status/</a>.  The page is automatically generated from the <code>pnetlib</code>
source code, and so will always reflect the latest changes.
</blockquote></p><p>

28 December 2001:

<blockquote>
Released <code>treecc</code> version 0.0.6, which includes alignment
fixes for 64-bit Solaris, some changes to the structure of generated
"switch" statements to alleviate compilation problems with gcc 3.0,
and a few other bug fixes.  See the <code>NEWS</code> file for more
information.
</blockquote></p><p>

 Other Questions
</h1>
<a name="mono">
<h2>Do you cooperate with the Mono project?</h2>
</a>
<p class="maincontent">
In April 2002, we added I18N (internationalization) support to
Portable.NET, under the usual "GPL plus linking exception" license.
We were looking for ways to increase cooperation with Mono, and Mono
has a policy of not accepting code under our usual license.  As an
experiment in co-operation, the DotGNU Steering Committee offered the
I18N code to Mono under the X11 license.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
Mono did use this code, but contributed very few changes to it.
Meanwhile, we did a lot more work on this library, more than doubling
its size.  So we decided to go back to our standard license for the
new version.  The original version remains, of course, available
under the X11 license.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
We're still interested in ways of increasing cooperation with the Mono
developers, in ways that would be mutually beneficial to Portable.NET
and Mono.
