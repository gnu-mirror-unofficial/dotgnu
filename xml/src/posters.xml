<H1>The New Face of DotGNU</H1>
<P>
The goal of this project is to provide DotGNU with a new logo, slogan,
and poster. With the upcoming 0.5.0 release of pnet, and a new year 
beginning, it is a good time to redress DotGNU and let the world
know what we've been working on. This project will compose of several
separate sections:
</P>
<H2>Poster</H2>
<P>
This new poster will emphasize the freedom aspects of
Free software, raise awareness for DotGNU, and briefly describe what
DotGNU consists of. We will make sure that these posters are 
put up in highly-visible places such as university campuses.
</P>
<P>
Please use GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program for creating
graphics files for this project, and put them under the GNU Free
Documentation License.
</P>
<H2>Slogan</H2>
<P>
While our current slogan of <EM>Making The Web Work For You</EM> is
great, we would like to see what other people can come up with. So if
you have some witty verbiage you'd like to spew out, let us know, and
you may get to see your words plastered all over the world.
</P>
<H2>Logo</H2>
<P>
Same story with the logo. We think the one we have rocks, but I am also 
excited to see what other people can come up with. So please, if you're
talented in this sort of thing, help us out.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Distribution and Fund Raising Organizer</H2>
<P>
We need someone to organize distribution and the funds for poster printing.
If you have experience in this area and would like us to be forever 
indebted to you, please contact us.
</P>
<P>
These are some of the current ideas we have<UL>

<LI>It should be possible to find at every campus at least volunteer
who cares enough about Free Software to help us out by making sure
that the posters are put up in good places.</LI>

<LI>However, producing the posters will require funding.  We need a
significant number of posters to reach all computer science
departments (how many are there, worldwide, anyway?).  Postage will
be a significant expense too.</LI>

<LI>How do we get funding for this?  Maybe it is best to approach
companies which are <EM>not</EM> in the software business concerning
this. </LI>

<LI>Since this project needs funding anyway, we could try to get some
additional funding so that we can hold a competition and have some
nice prizes for those who contributed significantly to what is in the
end chosen as DotGNU poster.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Contact Us</H2>

The coordinating committee for this project currently
consists of Ian Fung (irc nick: alias) and Norbert Bollow
(irc nick: nb).  Both can often be found on the irc channel
#dotgnu at irc.freenode.net and they can also be reached via the
email address posters&#64;dotgnu.org. Details about contest
dates and submissions will be posted later.
