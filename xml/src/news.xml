<p>
	The DotGNU project is undergoing a restructuring due to the 
	reduced threat of Microsoft's .NET deployment plan. The plans
	for a new and improved version of DotGNU can be found here.

<h2>Oct 12-10-2002: Weekend Warriors Programme</h2>
<p>
	To speed up the compiler development , Peter Minten, Gopal.V and 
	Andrew Mitchell have formed the Weekend Warriors. This is a group
	of part time developers who devote their weekends to hacking pnet.
	This is responsible for the flurry of activity which happens on
	every weekend. The group proposes to take part of the compiler
	development in the following announcement.:

<h2>Oct 10-10-2002: Meetathon - III</h2>
<p>
	As is customary, DotGNU will be having a Meet-a-thon this quarter
	as well. This is an event to take stock of the last quarter 
	for the DotGNU developers, and an excellent oppurtunity for newcomers
	to familiarize themselves with the project. See the proposal for

<h2>Oct 02-10-2002: Java Bytecode Output for Portable.Net</h2>
<p>
	Sylvain Pasche has fixed up the Portable.Net assembler to generate
	the correct java bytecode. Now the C# compiler sports a nice JVM 
	output backend. The results become really interesting when the 
	whole pnetlib can be compiled into JVM code. Read full details
