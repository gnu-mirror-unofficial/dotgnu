<p>
	The Dotgnu Webservice container , otherwise known as the 
	Dotgnu execution environment (DGEE) has reached usable
	levels. Chris Smith has hacked up this server which does
	not run inside Apache , but adopts the strategy other
	AppServers like Tomcat has been using. The C# webservice 
	system is functional and uses Apache and 
	<a href="http://www.nfluid.com">Goldwater</a>
	as the network and execution containers respectively. The 
	system is self documenting and includes introspection into 
	the webservices. It currently supports only XmlRpc and is
	only a pre-release.	An initial demonstration was put up by 
	Adam Ballai

Chris Smith has brought out a nice specification for the DGEE core module
communication. The good thing about this is that it is not tied down to XML
or any encoding format, but allows arbitary data chunks such as XML, C# 
byte code, HTML form post data etc to be packaged together and sent as a 
single message between the internal components of the VRS/SEE core
