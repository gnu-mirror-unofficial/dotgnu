</a>
<p>
	At today's irc meeting, the release date for DotGNU 0.1
	has been fixed at end-September.  For Portable.NET the
	goals are to get pnetC to basic usefulness, fix as many
	system.xml bugs as we can, and make the core button/textbox/scroll

	<h2>July 26-07-2003: Portable.NET 0.5.10 released</h2>
</a>
<p>
	Breaking the tradition, which required a 0.6.0 this time , the 
	pnet developers have decided to put out 0.5.10, 0.5.12, etc, 
	as release candidates for 0.6.0, which will be part of DotGNU 0.1.
</p>
<p>
	A lot has happened this release.  The System.Windows.Forms namespace is
	coming along well. The DotGNU community has chipped in more than its
	fair share of it this release - particularly Simon Guindon, Neil Cawse, 
	Richard Baumann, Ian Fung, Cecilio Pardo, and the relentless Gopal V.
	Threading now works very well (thanks to Thong Nguyen aka tum) and 
	Reflection.Emit (Richard Baumann) too. The C compiler has advanced 
	enough to compile most C programs. The pnetC now has significant bits
	of glibc and is looking for people to help port the rest of glibc here.
	The CVM unroller was also rewritten into a generic framework that should
	be much easier to port to new architectures.

	The generic unroller has finally hit pnet cvs. The unroller is
	responsible for producing native code (much like a JIT) for the pnet

	native code generation, like opcode values and register ordering, from
	generic features, like register allocation, greatly simplifying the

	ports are already working and support for IA-64, PPC, and Alpha is in
	the works. For more details, read the mailing list

and a huge number of new classes have been implemented in pnetlib, including
support for IPv6 and IrDA networking.
</p>
<p>
We have also begun implementation of the System.Windows.Forms library,
built on top of the X11 library.  This means that it will be able to run
on any X11-capable system.  Currently tested to work on x86-based GNU/Linux
systems and ppc-based MacOS X systems.

We are looking for volunteers to help us implement the "x11-winforms"
library as quickly as possible, and to test it on as many platforms as
possible.

Finally, the ml-pnet project has been started to provide ports of certain
Mono C# libraries.  System.Data (ADO.NET) currently works, and we hope to

still to do:

<ol>
<li>Building the treecc nodes in the parser for the remaining syntax.</li>
<li>VB-specific semantic analysis and codegen routines.</li>
<li>Flesh out the standard library in pnetlib/Basic.</li>
<li>Build test cases for the compiler in cscctest.</li>
<li>Build test cases for the standard library in pnetlib/Basic.</li>

1 and 2 require cscc compiler skills - if you're interested in learning the 
compiler, then this is the time to start.  The Java, VB, C#, and C front ends 
will all need lots of eager beavers over the next few months.
3, 4, and 5 are easier, mainly requiring C# and/or VB programming skills.

<p>
	The <a href="http://qtcsharp.sf.net/">Qt#</a> project has managed to 
	compile its libraries and run the sample programs included with Qt#
	on Portable.Net. Excluding the Xml based bindings generator program , 
	the rest of	Qt# compile and run with ease on Portable.Net. The 
	screenshots have been put up for a peek at Gui programming with

	<h2>Nov 21-11-2002: DGEE &amp; Intermodule Messaging.</h2>
</a>
<p>

Chris Smith has brought out a nice specification for the DGEE core module
communication. The good thing about this is that it is not tied down to XML
or any encoding format, but allows arbitary data chunks such as XML, C# 
byte code, HTML form post data etc to be packaged together and sent as a 
single message between the internal components of the VRS/SEE core 
<a href="http://www.nfluid.com/dgee/dgee.html">DGEE</a>.
