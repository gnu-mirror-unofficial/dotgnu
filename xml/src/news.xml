<h2>Oct 28-10-2002: Portable.NET's cscc compiles pnetlib </h2>
<p>
	With the application of a
	<a href="http://www.dotgnu.info/pipermail/developers/2002-October/008504.html">
	small</a> patch to pnetlib (it changes only 5 lines), cscc can compile all
	of pnetlib. This means pnetlib hackers can directly test their modifications.

<h2>Oct 25-10-2002: Daily builds of pnetlib </h2>
<p>
	Charles Schuller (Kyeran) has provided us with a 
	<a href="http://www.hermes-solutions.biz/pnetlib.html">
	daily build 
	</a>
	of Portable.Net libraries. A 
	<a href="http://csserver.evansville.edu/~sc87/dotgnu/pnetlib-dlls/">
	mirror </a> of these as well as tarballs of CVS HEAD source has been 
	provided by Stephen Compall (S11001001).

<h2>Oct 19-10-2002: IRC Meeting with Parrot Developers</h2>
<p>
	The IRC meeting to discuss adding <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org">
	Parrot</a> to the bytecodes supported by Portable.Net was a great 
	success. The Parrot designer was here to discuss the details of 
	generating Parrot from C#. Read all about it

<h2>Oct 18-10-2002: DotGNU Focus and Direction</h2>
<p>
	The DotGNU project is undergoing a restructuring due to the 
	reduced threat of Microsoft's .NET deployment plan. The plans
	for a new and improved version of DotGNU can be found here.
	<a href="http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2002-October/008321.html">
	here. 
	</a> The focus shift is from total .NET compatibility to a more
	useful and creative applications of DotGNU technologies.

<h2>Oct 12-10-2002: Weekend Warriors Programme</h2>
<p>
	To speed up the compiler development , Peter Minten, Gopal.V and 
	Andrew Mitchell have formed the Weekend Warriors. This is a group
	of part time developers who devote their weekends to hacking pnet.
	This is responsible for the flurry of activity which happens on
	every weekend. The group proposes to take part of the compiler
	development in the following announcement.:

<h2>Oct 10-10-2002: Meetathon - III</h2>
<p>
	As is customary, DotGNU will be having a Meet-a-thon this quarter
	as well. This is an event to take stock of the last quarter 
	for the DotGNU developers, and an excellent oppurtunity for newcomers
	to familiarize themselves with the project. See the proposal for

<h2>Oct 02-10-2002: Java Bytecode Output for Portable.Net</h2>
<p>
	Sylvain Pasche has fixed up the Portable.Net assembler to generate
	the correct java bytecode. Now the C# compiler sports a nice JVM 
	output backend. The results become really interesting when the 
	whole pnetlib can be compiled into JVM code. Read full details
