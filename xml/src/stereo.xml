<h1>
 DotGNU doesn't want to lock you into a single bytecode system
</h1>
<h2>The plan to support Java and JVM</h2>
<p>
From a marketing strategy perspective, Microsoft's primary goal with the .NET
platform is to "kill" Java.  If this should succeed it would be a significant
boost to their monopolistic ambitions; the DotGNU project definately has no
desire to promote C# over Java.  We made the decision early on that we would
like to equally support both Java and C#, and both bytecode systems (JVM and
CLR).  
</p>
<p>
A significant amount of work has been done in this direction. Our compiler
suite is not only able to emit bytecode for the Microsoft-designed CLR, but it
can also be used to generate bytecode for the JVM. We also have a Java-compiler
front-end. Unfortunately, both of these areas of coding work are current
dormant for lack of volunteers.
</p>
<p>
These Java efforts will probably remain dormant until someone steps forward
and volunteers to champion them.
</p>
<h2>Support for future innovative bytecode systems</h2>
<p>
There can be no doubt that technological innovation in the area of
bytecode systems will continue.  In particular,
<a href="http://parrotcode.org">Parrot</a>, the bytecode system of the
Perl 6 project, looks very interesting.
</p>
<p>
The architecture of DotGNU allows to add back-ends for additional
bytecode systems to the cscc compiler system, and additional VMs
to the DGEE webservice server.
</p>
<h2>Migration between bytecode systems</h2>
<p>
Since both the compiler suite and the webservice server are designed
to support a choice of multiple bytecode system, migration from one
byecode system to another can be done gradually, one program at a
time.  This could be described as <em>"stereo"</em> of two bytecode
systems.
