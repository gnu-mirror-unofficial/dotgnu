 Mailing lists
</h1>
<p>
The main mailing list is the DEVELOPERS mailling list.  Subscribe at
<a href="&nav.mail;developers">http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listindo/developers</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition there is a number of specialized discussion mailing lists.
A complete list follows.
</p>
<h2> Mailing Lists of the DotGNU project </h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  The <a href="&nav.mail;developers">DEVELOPERS</a>
  mailing list focuses on mainstream DotGNU development work.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="&nav.mail;visionaries">VISIONARIES</a>
  mailing list is for discussion of ideas and projects which are somewhat
  outside the focus of the DotGNU project, including truly innovative ideas.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="&nav.mail;pnet-developers">PNET-DEVELOPERS</a>
  mailing list is for developent discussions (and bugs) of DotGNU Portable.NET,
  including e.g. <code>cscc</code>, <code>ilrun</code>, pnetlib, and pnetC>.
  Topics include bugs, feature requests, interoperability testing, newbies 
  looking for work, etc.
 </li>
  The <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/phpgroupware-developers">PHPGROUPWARE-DEVELOPERS</a>
  mailing list is for developent discussions of phpGroupWare.
 <li>
  The <a href="&nav.mail;announce">ANNOUNCE</a>
  mailing list for press releases and other important announcements
  concerning the DotGNU system.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="&nav.mail;auth">AUTH</a> mailing list is for
  discussing the <a href="&nav.auth;">DotGNU Virtual
  Identities</a> system.  This list has been silent for some time.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Please avoid cross-posting to multiple of these lists.  If something
 needs a broader audience than just one of the specialized mailing
 lists, post it to DEVELOPERS.
</p>
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<a name="filter">
<h2>How do I filter mail from the developers list into a separate folder?</h2>
<p>
  Make a procmail recipe that filters on the List-ID: header.  This
  header is guaranteed to always be the same, regardless of which of
  the three available email addresses (developers@dotgnu.org,
  developer@dotgnu.info, dotgnu-developers@gnu.org) people use for
  posting to the list.
</p>

<a name="democracy">
<H2 class="mainsubheading">Do we have some degree of democracy in DotGNU?</H2>
</a>
<p class="maincontent">
  So far the only &quot;institution&quot; in DotGNU is the DotGNU Steering
  Committee, which has been appointed by RMS.  So right now DotGNU
  cannot be a democracy in the usual sense, simply because the
  necessary democratic institutions and procedures have not been
  established.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
  It would not be easy to turn a Free Software project like DotGNU
  into a true democracy.  It would have to be a <em>constitutional</em>
  democracy because there are standards and ethical principles
  which cannot be allowed to be simply changed by a majority vote.
  Also the core of the DotGNU vision (which makes it a solution to the
  vendor lock-in problem for webservices) may be refined, but not
  discarded.  There would need to be structures in place which prevent
  people who do not agree with these key things from
  &quot;hijacking&quot; DotGNU.  We would need to have a constitution
  which defines some democratic institutions and their responsibilities, as
  well as procedures for selecting the members and the leaders of
  these institutions.  Setting this all up in a way that actually
  works will require a lot of effort, as well as trial-and-error.
  Doing this here in DotGNU would be a huge distraction, which we
  cannot afford.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
  So what DotGNU needs is a simpler structure that will still give
  us most or all of the benefits of a constitutional democracy.  We
  have established such a structure, as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  1. DotGNU is a volunteer-driven project where everyone is given the
     freedom to work on whatever they consider to be important, and
     what has to do with creating a successful webservices platform
     which is founded on the GNU philosophy.

  2. The DotGNU Steering Committee (which has been appointed by
     Richard Stallman, the founder and leader of the GNU project)
     will, when necessary, serve as "high court" to resolve any
     conflicts between contributors, and it will work to make 
     sure that the project remains faithful to its mission.

  3. Most actual decisions are made in the development projects.
     Each project has a leader who establishes a decision-making
     process.  This does not need to be a democratic process,
     because projects which make bad decisions can be forked.
     (This possibility of forking makes mismanagement much
     less likely to happen, and hence there will probably not
     be a need for many forks.)

  4. Mailing lists have been established for facilitating a free
     flow of discussions on various matters related to DotGNU.
     Use of the lists in ways which harm the DotGNU project will
     not be tolerated.  Here are some examples of behavior which
     will not be tolerated:
     - making FUD-like claims without substantiating them upon request
     - &quot;name calling&quot; and bullying
     - advertising or recommending proprietary software in any way
     - making postings which seem to be illegal according to the
       laws of the country where the mailing list server is located
       (currently the USA).
     People who do such or similar things may be moderated,
     kicked off the list, or banned.  The offending postings may
     be removed from the list's archives.
