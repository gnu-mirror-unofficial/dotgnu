<h1>
 Overall Architecture Of The DotGNU Webservices Platform
</h1>
<h2>DGEE</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
DGEE, the DotGNU Execution Environment provides the core webservice component
of DotGNU and provides the functionality of accepting, validating and
satisfying web service requests.
</p>
<h2>VMs</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
DGEE will be capable of executing multiple different bytecode formats
in appropriate Virtual Machine implementations (VMs).  The dotgnu-pnet
is building (among many other things, which include compilers and system
libraries) a VM implementation for <a href="&nav.acronyms;#IL">IL</a>.
For Java bytecode, we will use one of the existing available Free
<a href="&nav.acronyms;#JVM">JVM</a> implementations, possibly SableVM.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
Support for other popular Free Software bytecode systems is also considered
desirable, such as in particular Python bytecode and 
<include file="navlinks.xml" entry="parrot" />, the bytecode
system of Perl6.  (In fact Parrot aims to become the bytecode
language of choice for a whole range of dynamic languages.)
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
In addition, DotGNU would like to be the platform of choice for computer
science research projects on innovative new bytecode systems.  (Some early
discussion of such ideas has occured on the
<a href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/arch">arch mailing list</a> 
but this has not led to concrete development efforts yet.
</p>
<h2>Webservice protocols</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
All components of DotGNU will support the standard webservice protocols for
synchronous webservice interactions such as XML-RPC and SOAP, and in addition
asynchronous webservice interactions via Jabber will be supported.
</p>
<h2>SEE</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
SEE, DotGNU's Secure Execution Environment, is a component which can download
bytecode from the network and execute it in a secure manner.  This allows in
particular for webservice applications to transmit to its user's PCs bytecode
that implements nice user interfaces.
</p>
<h2>DEE</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
DotGNU's Distributed Execution Environment (DEE) will be like an
operating system for a "distributed computer" consisting of
several instances of the "DotGNU Secure Execution Environment"
that are running on several computers.  This means that when
any one of these component systems fails, all services will
still be available (although with reduced connection capacity,
and possibly with reduced performance).  The DEE system must be able
to take care of replicating databases across all the parts of this
"distributed computer" and propagating updates.
</p>
<h2>VRS</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
DotGNU's Virtual remote Server (VRS) will be an alternative to the DEE with the
difference that it will be a peer-to-peer system, and not a centrally
administrated system like the DEE.
</p>
<h2>DotGNU Virtual Identities</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
DotGNU's native authentication and authorization subsystem will probably
be founded on a FOAF-based virtual identities system.  In addition,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/macs">MACS, the Modular Access Control
System</a> will be available for integrating DotGNU with other auth systems, as
well as making DotGNU's authentication and authorization subsystem available
to non-DotGNU-based applications.
</p>
<h1>Webservice applications</h1>
<p class="maincontent">
In addition to the components of a Webservice platform, and development tools,
there are also a few (currently two) development projects for webservice
applications which are part of DotGNU: phpGroupware und Forum.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
DotGNU webservice applications export their functionality via webservice
protocols such as XML-RPC , while they can at the same time also be used
as browser-based "web applications".  When the needed infrastructure (SEE)
is available, downloadable user interfaces will be added as a third option
for accessing the webservice applications.
