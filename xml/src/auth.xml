<h1>
 Wanted: A good "auth" project
</h1>
<p>
 We think that DotGNU should probably contain a "Virtual ID" system
 (see below for details on what we mean with that), even if there is
 currently no such project part of DotGNU.  A project in this area
 which agrees with DotGNU's goals would be very welcome to become
 part of the DotGNU meta-project.
</p>
<p>
 It has been suggested that DotGNU's native authentication and authorization
 subsystem could founded on a FOAF-based virtual identities system.  In
 addition, DotGNU could use
 <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/macs">MACS, the Modular Access
  Control System</A>
 for integrating DotGNU with other auth systems, as well as making DotGNU's
 authentication and authorization subsystem available to non-DotGNU-based
 applications.
</p>
<p>
 Please use the <a href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/auth">DotGNU
 auth mailing list</a> for discussing these and other "auth" ideas for
 DotGNU.
</p>
<h1>
 DotGNU Virtual Identities
</h1>
<p>
 With a "Virtual ID" system we mean an integrated solution to the
 following problems:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Authentication
  </strong>
  <p>
   Basically, a <em>Virtual ID</em> consists in some digital information,
   and the user must be able to prove ownership of this Virtual ID.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Authorization
  </strong>
  <p>
   A user who has proved ownership of a Virtual ID may be authorized to
   access certain information, or perform certain actions.  Webservice
   servers must be able to verify this.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Customization
  </strong>
  <p>
   Users should be able to customize their internet experience:  There
   should be a way in which users can communicate their preferences to
   all webservice servers that want to take user preferences into
   consideration.  This must be set up in a way that avoids violating the
   user's privacy.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Selected Sharing of Private Data
  </strong>
  <p>
   There should be a simple way in which a website can request private
   information such as email address, postal address, telephone number,
   fax number, or credit card number from the user.  Such private
   information must never be given to the website without explicit
   approval from the user, but the user should not be required to enter
   the information every time.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 We must NOT create a passport "portal".  That is technically and
 morally wrong.  We must create a framework that can be scaled and
 deployed at any level desired, whether locally, at an enterprise,
 or at a portal.  Authentication and access to private information
 should be peer to peer to preserve local storage of those things
 which should remain in private users hands.  The ability to migrate
 data upward can be provided for, on a selective basis, and controls
 must be provided as to who may or may not access specific user
 information.
</p>
<p>
 For extremely high reliability (avoiding any single point of
 failure) this framework can be run on top of the DotGNU
 Distributed Execution Environment.  (For more information about this
 please refer to the <a href="&nav.arch;">DotGNU Platform</a> page.)
</p>
<h2>
 Suggested terminology
</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <em>Profile Host</em>: Hosts profiles ("virtual identities")
  to facilitate remote access.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>Profile Owner</em>: Owns profile data and controls access to
  it.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>Service Provider</em>: Creates and delivers Web Services that
  request profile data.
 </li>
</ul>
