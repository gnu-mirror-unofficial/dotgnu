 We have obtained

</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>Can I start a new DotGNU development project?</h2>
<p>
  While we're primarily interested in moving forward with the existing
  projects, getting additional Free Software development projects officially
  approved as part of DotGNU is not out of the question, provided they have
  a focus on webservices or on IL or on C#.
</p>
<p>
  Proposals will be evaluated in the light of the overall objectives
  of the DotGNU project:
  <ol>
   <li>Uphold the standards and ethical principles of the GNU project.</li>
   <li>DotGNU must be a solution to the
     <a href="danger.html#lock-in">vendor lock-in problem for
     webservices</a>.</li>
   <li>Within the constraints 1. and 2., cooperate as much as
     possible with other projects.</li>
   <li>Within the constraints 1., 2. and 3., do whatever it takes to
     make DotGNU a winner.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  The DotGNU project has some <a href="list.html#democracy">organisational
  principles</a> which are designed to give most if not all of the benefits
  of a constitutional democracy without the organisational overhead.  Based
  on these principles, use of the DotGNU mailing lists, irc channel and wiki
  is not restricted to the official DotGNU development projects
  only.  The <em>freedom for everyone to work on whatever they consider to be
  important, and what has to do with creating a successful webservices
  platform which is founded on the GNU philosophy</em> is considered to be
  more important than which projects are officially part of DotGNU and GNU.
</p>
<H2 class="mainsubheading">I'm starting a development project.  What name should I use?</H2>

<p class="maincontent">
  Just use any name of your choice.  When your project has been
  accepted into DotGNU, you can call it &quot;&lt;Projectname&gt;, a Project of
  DotGNU&quot;.  Therefore it is not necessary for your Savannah project
  name to contain the string &quot;dotgnu&quot;.
</p>

<H2 class="mainsubheading">What are the requirements for starting a DotGNU development project?</H2>

<p class="maincontent">
  You need to make a commitment to putting your code under the GNU
  General Public License, possibly with linking exceptions as
  appropriate.  
  Also you need to make sure that there are no legal hooks on the
  software that would prevent it from being truly Free Software.
  For example, if you have a trademark or servicemark on the name
  of the program, then you need to give us a license which allows to
  use this mark in connection with this program and derivative works
  thereof, which which also gives us the right to give these rights to
  others.  Similarly, if you have patents that are related to your
  development project, then you need to make them available through a
  free patent license.  If you have applied for patents which have not
  been granted yet, then you need to make a contractual commitment to
  making these patents available though such a free patent license if
  they are granted.
</p>

<p class="maincontent">
  For programs which are intended to be used by end-users, you need
  to think about making the program useful also to computer users
  with disabilities.  These thougths should be summarized in a
  "Disability Impact Statement" like the following example:

<pre>
  Disability Impact Statement
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The DotGNU Secure Execution Environment (SEE) is the part
  of the webservices system where client-side components of
  webservices are executed; this includes in particular the
  parts of the program which implement the user interface.
  Support for assistive devices for disabled users is provided by
  specialized SEE plugins.  Each of these plugins provides an API
  for one assistive device; the plugin can also be used without
  the assistive device in a simulation mode that allows
  (non-disabled) software developers to easily get a first
  impression of the user experience of any given program for
  disabled users.
</pre>
