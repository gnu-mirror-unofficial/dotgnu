<h3>About DotGNU</h3>
<strong><a name="1.00">1.00 What is DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  DotGNU is a Free Software project to create a platform for
  webservices that can be written in a variety of different
  programming languages including Java and C#.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.01">1.01 Why do you do this?</a></strong><br><br>

  Microsoft is trying to catch all e-commerce in their .NET and lock
  everyone in.  For details see the article <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/articles/issue15/lu15-Cover_feature-Tempted_by_net.pdf">"Tempted by .NET?"</a> by
  Richard Hillesley:  Linux User No 15 (Oct 2001), p. 15-21.
  We consider these plans to be evil, and we want to prevent them from
  being successful.  At the same time, the webservices approach is
  truly useful for some things, if the vendor lock-in problem can be
  solved.  So we provide a webservices platform which provides a
  solution not only to the technical problems, but also to the vendor
  lock-in business problem.  E-commerce websites will prefer this
  system, and thereby we can prevent the internet from falling under
  Microsoft's control.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.02">1.02 What do you mean with "Free Software"?</a></strong><br><br>

  In "Free Software", the word "free" refers to freedom, not price.
  For the definition of "Free Software" please refer to
    http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
  For an explanation of why this is very important please refer to
    http://thinkcoach.com/free-software.html<br><br>

<strong><a name="1.03">1.03 Can I make money using DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  Yes, of course.  In fact the main thrust of the DotGNU project
  is to provide a suitable platform for serious business
  applications of the webservices concept.  DotGNU webservices
  are useful for every e-commerce website.<br><br>

  For example, you can use webservices to make your website
  react to the specific needs of every potential customer with a
  business proposal that meets these needs exactly.<br><br>

  Also, if you provide a valuable webservice, it may be
  possible to charge for providing this service.  For example,
  one of the members of the DotGNU Steering Committee runs a
  mailing list hosting business which is implemented as a
  webservice.  The owners of the mailing lists pay the hosting
  company for this service.<br><br>

  The DotGNU webservices platform allows you to provide
  webservices in a way that gives your potential customers the
  assurance that you're not going to "lock them in" by making
  it difficult or impossible to move away from your service.  
  This feature of the DotGNU webservices platform will allow
  you to close more sales that you otherwise could.<br><br>

<strong><a name="1.04">1.04 What are webservices good for?</a></strong><br><br>

  When a program is implemented as a "webservice", its functionality
  can be used by other programs which can be implemented in any
  programming language, and which can run on any computer which is
  connected to the internet.  This makes it possible for example that
  multiple users in different parts of the world can interact with a
  single set of data.<br><br>
  
  
<strong><a name="1.05">1.05 How do you define "webservice"?</a></strong><br><br>

  "Webservices" are any services that are offered on the web
  (regardless of what technology is used to provide them).<br><br>

   In order to turn this statement into an actual definition,
   these explanations need to be added:<br><br>

   a) With "service" we mean not only that some functionality is
      provided, but that there should also be some description of
      this functionality, namely how the service should be used and
      what it provides.<br><br>

   b) With saying that the service is "offered on the web" we mean
      that it's offered on the internet via standard protocols,
      i.e. protocols that are open, widely published, and freely
      available for anyone to implement.<br><br>

   It is sometimes useful to distinguish between "webservice
   components" which are meant to be used by other webservices, and
   "webservice applications" which are meant to be used by humans
   more directly.  Both "webservice components" and "webservice
   applications" are "webservices" as defined above.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.06">1.06 What about other definitions of "webservice"?</a></strong><br><br>

  A definition attempt by the Stencil Group has been discussed in some
  detail on the DotGNU developers mailing list, in these messages:<br><br>
<font size="-1">
  * <a href="http://archive.dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2001-November/001252.html">http://archive.dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2001-November/001252.html</a><br>

</font><br><br>

<strong><a name="1.07">1.07 What are the benefits of using a remote webservice, as opposed </a>
  to executing the same program on your own computer?</strong><br><br>

  Apart from special circumstances (like when you need to process 
  huge amounts of data that your local computer cannot handle) there 
  is a benefit to using a webservice only when the same set of data 
  needs to be accessed by multiple people, or when a user needs to 
  be able to access the same set of data from multiple computers.<br><br>

  For example, the straightforward way to implement mailing list
  hosting is to do it as a webservice, and that is exactly what the
  implementors of Mailman, the GNU mailing list program, have done.<br><br>

  On the other hand there is little benefit from implementing e.g. a
  text editor as a webservice unless there are features to allow
  multiple users to edit the same file at the same time.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.08">1.08 Can webservices have a better user interface than what is</a> 
  possible in a web-browser?</strong><br><br>

  Yes.  The DotGNU Secure Execution Environment (SEE) allows the
  webservice to execute code on the user's desktop computer without
  creating a security risk for that computer.  In particular, SEE
  is meant to facilitate the creation of good, very portable user
  interfaces.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.09">1.09 Is our data stored on the webservice server?</a></strong><br><br>

  Data can be stored either locally or on the webservice server.  If
  multiple users need to interact with the same set of data, then it
  should probably be stored on the webservice server.<br><br>

  This raises the legitimate concern of whether a webservice provide
  can "lock in" customers by making it inconvenient or impossible for
  them to get at their data; this issue is addressed in the following
  questions.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.10">1.10 Can we move to a different webservice provider?</a></strong><br><br>

  The DotGNU webservice server requires that for each webservice 
  and each set of data that it acts on, there is an "owner of the 
  data" who has the right to download the entire set of data together 
  with the program which implements the webservice.  Program which 
  have been downloaded in this way can be executed in any 
  DotGNU Secure Execution Environment on a desktop computer or 
  on a DotGNU webservices server.<br><br>

  (This means that when there is a need for an application to use 
  data from multiple sources, where no-one has ownership rights to 
  all the data, then the application must be divided into multiple 
  webservice components.)<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.11">1.11 Can we get source code for the webservice programs?</a></strong><br><br>

  If all of the following conditions are met, then the webservice
  provider is required to distribute the source code for the 
  webservice program to you, upon your request:<br><br>

  * The webservice program has been licensed to the webservice
    provider under the terms of the GNU General Public License, or it
    is a derivative work of such a program.<br><br>

  * The webservice program runs on a DotGNU webservice server.<br><br>

  * You are recognized as an "owner of the data" for this webservice.<br><br>

  Then the webservice server will upon your request distribute the
  program to you in binary form.  According the terms of the GNU
  General Public License, this implies that the webservice provider
  must upon request distribute the source code for the webservice
  program to you.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.12">1.12 Am I obligated to give away my webservice source code?</a></strong><br><br>

You are not automatically obligated to distribute your source
code, and you are certainly not obligated to just give it away.
However, if you sell webservice services, then your customers
will expect that you make them the "owner of the data" which the
webservice uses, and depending on the exact circumstances that
may indirectly give these customers a right to get the source
code upon request.  Here are the details:<br><br>

If you provide a webservice using a GPL'd webservice program
(which you may have modified), then the "owner of the data"
will be able to obtain the webservices programs under the terms
of the GNU GPL, and this implies in particular that they will
have a right to get the source code of the exact version of the
program which you're using.  The terms of the GNU GPL also
require you to make a written promise to this "owner of the
data" that you will be willing to provide the source code upon
request.  This ensures that the "owner of the data" will know
about this right to the source code.<br><br>

The "owner of the data" is typically a paying customer, and the
fact that the customer has a right to get the source code
increases the value of the service you provide.  Therefore you
will be able to charge a higher price and/or close more sales.<br><br>

You can use the DotGNU development tools to program your own
webservices (instead of just modifying the webservice programs
which are distributed with DotGNU, or which others have made
available under the GNU GPL) and then your are not required to
make source code for these webservices available to the customer
who is the "owner of the data".  However, even in these
situations where you are not required to make the source code
available to your customers, we strongly encourage you to
provide the source code to your customers under the terms of the
GNU GPL anyway.  We believe that this is ethically the right
thing to do, and that it will be good for your business.  <br><br>

<strong><a name="1.13">1.13 What do you mean with "webservice platform"?</a></strong><br><br>

  With "webservice platform" we mean a collection of software that
  allows you to create and deliver useful webservices:<br><br>

   * A (distributed) server platform that can host webservice
     components in a reliable manner (without any single point of
     failure).<br><br>

   * A Secure Execution Environment (SEE) that allows end-users to
     securely execute client-side components of webservices.<br><br>

   * A collection of standard webservice components.<br><br>

   * Protocols and implementations of these protocols for connecting
     webservice components with each other.<br><br>

   * System administration tools that allow to maintain distributed
     systems of webservices in an orderly manner.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.14">1.14 Do I have to pay to use DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  No.  Source code for all the software is available free of
  charge.  If you're capable of compiling the packages yourself
  and combining them into a system that meets your needs, then
  you don't have to pay anything for getting and using DotGNU.
  Also there are plans for providing a CD-ROM with all the
  client-side parts of the DotGNU platform (essentially SEE and a
  lot of plugins for SEE) as source code and executables for all
  major desktop operating systems.  This CD-ROM will be made
  available free of charge.<br><br>

  Of course the business side of all this cannot work out unless
  the DotGNU project has a good way to generate revenue.  For this
  reason, a commercial "DotGNU server" distribution will be sold,
  together with commercial support and additional consulting
  services.  The "DotGNU server" distribution will come with the
  full freedom rights of GNU GPL licensing.  This will help to
  make "DotGNU server" a very attractive product for all serious
  e-commerce companies.<br><br>

<strong><a name="1.15">1.15 What do I need to get to use DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  If you just want to be able to use DotGNU webservices that are
  already offered somewhere on the internet, all you need will be
  on the DotGNU CD-ROM which will be made available free of
  charge.<br><br>

  If you want to create or host webservices, then you should buy
  the most recent "DotGNU server" distribution.<br><br>

<strong><a name="1.16">1.16 What programming languages are supported in DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  We want to support Java in the same way as C#/CLR (as per 
  Microsoft's ECMA specs) will also be supported.  As soon as Parrot
  (the bytecode system of Perl6) is available, it will probably be 
  added to the list of bytecode systems that we want to support.<br><br>

  Note that with the support for Java bytecode, all other programming
  languages that can be compiled to Java bytecode will also be
  available, for example Ada95.  Also, all programs that are written
  for .NET (for example in Visual Basic) should work with DotGNU.<br><br>

  In addition, there is work in progress on porting the "Mercury"
  programming language of the University of Melbourne so that it
  can be compiled using the development tools of DotGNU 
  Portable.NET.<br><br>
  
<strong><a name="1.17">1.17 Will C and C++ be supported in DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  Code which is written in C or C++ can be used with DotGNU, *if* it
  is distributed with DotGNU or otherwise installed like you normally
  install software.  However you cannot use C or C++ to implement
  webservice programs that are meant to run in the Secure Execution
  Environment (SEE), like it will be possible with e.g. Java, Ada, C#
  and Perl - at least not until someone solves the difficult issues of
  compiling C to some kind of portable intermediate representation in
  such a way that the Secure Execution Environment can efficiently
  verify that the program is not trying to do something malicious.<br><br>


<strong><a name="1.18">1.18 Can I sell webservice programs for DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  Yes.  If you have a good webservice program that you're willing to 
  put under GNU GPL, then you may be able to sell it to DotGNU.  
  You can also market your webservice programs directly.  It is not 
  necessary for webservice programs which will be executed in the 
  Secure Execution Environment SEE (either on a webservice server 
  or on the client's PC) to use a GPL-compatible license.  The 
  DotGNU libraries that you will want to use from such programs all 
  come with a "linking exception" (see below) that allows you to use 
  them for any webservice program, regardless of how your program 
  is licensed.<br><br>
  
<strong><a name="1.19">1.19 Can I sell plugins for SEE?</a></strong><br><br>

  Yes.  In fact, if your plugins are good, and you are willing to
  make them GPL'd Free Software, you will have the options of
  selling them to DotGNU, or marketing them through DotGNU
  Marketing.<br><br>

  Alternatively, you are free to market your plugins directly to
  people who want to use them.  You need to be aware however that
  the see-plugin library (which implements the standard interface
  between the plugin and SEE) is licensed under the terms of GNU
  GPL.  Therefore, if you want to use this library (which is
  highly recommended) your plugins need to be Free Software with 
  a GPL-compatible license.  This may make it difficult to sell a
  large number of copies of your plugin.  It may be your best
  option to sell just one copy of each version of your plugin to
  DotGNU (licensed under GNU GPL), thereby enhancing the value 
  of the whole DotGNU system.<br><br>
  
<strong><a name="1.20">1.20 How can I see DotGNU in action?</a></strong><br><br>

  Think of a good webservice.  Then implement those parts of
  DotGNU which are still missing and which are needed by this
  webservice.  Then implement the webservice, announce it, and see
  how people are using it.<br><br>


<h3>Contributing to DotGNU</h3>

<strong><a name="2.00">2.00 Where can I contribute?</a></strong><br><br>

  The best way to get started is probably to subscribe to the three
  main mailing lists and send a message to one of them (wherever you
  feel it would be most appropriate) saying what kind of thing you'd
  like to help with, and what your skills are.<br><br>

  The main mailing lists are:<br><br>

  *<a href=" http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/developers"> http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/developers</a><br>
  * <a href="http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/arch">http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/arch</a><br>
  * <a href="http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/auth">http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/auth</a><br><br>


<strong><a name="2.01">2.01 How do I filter mail from the developers list into a separate</a>
  folder?</strong><br><br>

  Make a procmail recipe that filters on the List-ID: header.  This
  header is guaranteed to always be the same, regardless of which 
  of the three available email addresses (developers@dotgnu.org,
  developer@dotgnu.org, dotgnu-developers@gnu.org) people use 
  for posting to the list.<br><br>


<strong><a name="2.02">2.02 What software development projects are there in DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  Please refer to the website:<br>
  <a href="projects.html">http://www.dotgnu.org/projects.html</a><br>
  http://www.dotgnu.org/proposals.active.html<br><br>


<strong><a name="2.03">2.03 What packages need to get ready in time for DotGNU 1.0?</a></strong><br><br>

  The current list of packages needed for DotGNU 1.0 can be found on the <a href="tasklist.html">Task List</a> in the Projects section of this website.<br><br>

<strong><a name="2.04">2.04 Can I start a development project which is not on this list?</a></strong><br><br>

  Sure.  DotGNU is not a hierarchy.  The above list should be
  understood as a recommendation for areas to focus on.  It is
  not meant to stop you from other things that you consider to be
  important.<br><br>


<strong><a name="2.05">2.05 I'm starting a development project.  What name should I use?</a></strong><br><br>

  Just use any name of your choice.  When your project has been
  accepted into DotGNU, you can call it "<Projectname>, a Project of
  DotGNU".  Therefore it is not necessary for your Savannah project
  name to contain the string "dotgnu".<br><br>


<strong><a name="2.06">2.06 What are the requirements for starting a DotGNU development </a>
  project?</strong><br><br>

  You need to make a commitment to putting your code under the 
  GNU General Public License, possibly with linking exceptions as
  appropriate (for details about this, see section 3 of this FAQ).  
  Also you need to make sure that there are no legal hooks on the
  software that would prevent it from being truly Free Software.
  For example, if you have a trademark or servicemark on the name
  of the program, then you need to give us a license which allows to
  use this mark in connection with this program and derivative works
  thereof, which also gives us the right to give these rights to
  others.  Similarly, if you have patents that are related to your
  development project, then you need to make them available 
  through a free patent license.  If you have applied for patents which 
  have not been granted yet, then you need to make a contractual 
  commitment to making these patents available though such a free 
  patent license if they are granted.<br><br>
  
  
<strong><a name="2.07">2.07 How do I write a "Disability Impact Statement"?</a></strong><br><br>

  Here is an example... (in the case of SEE)<br><br>

  Disability Impact Statement<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
  The DotGNU Secure Execution Environment (SEE) is the part
  of the webservices system where client-side components of
  webservices are executed; this includes in particular the
  parts of the program which implement the user interface.
  Support for assistive devices for disabled users is provided by
  specialized SEE plugins.  Each of these plugins provides an API
  for one assistive device; the plugin can also be used without
  the assistive device in a simulation mode that allows
  (non-disabled) software developers to easily get a first
  impression of the user experience of any given program for
  disabled users.<br><br>
  
<strong><a name="2.08">2.08 How were the projects on the "DotGNU projects list" chosen?</a></strong><br><br>

  There aren't any precise, well-established criteria right now.  The
  main principles are:<br><br>

  1. Uphold the standards and ethical principles of GNU and
     FreeDevelopers.<br><br>

  2. DotGNU must be a solution to the vendor lock-in problem for
     webservices.  (See question 1.08)<br><br>

  3. Within the constraints 1. and 2., cooperate as much as
     possible with other projects.<br><br>

  4. Within the constraints 1., 2. and 3., do whatever it takes to
     make DotGNU a winner.<br><br>


<strong><a name="2.09">2.09 Do we have some degree of democracy in DotGNU?</a></strong><br><br>

  So far the only "institution" in DotGNU is the DotGNU Steering
  Committee, which has been appointed by RMS.  So right now 
  DotGNU cannot be a democracy in the usual sense, simply 
  because the necessary democratic institutions and procedures 
  have not been established.<br><br>

  It would not be easy to turn a Free Software project like DotGNU
  into a true democracy.  It would have to be a _constitutional_
  democracy because there are standards and ethical principles of
  GNU and FreeDevelopers which cannot be allowed to be simply 
  changed by a majority vote.  Also the core of the DotGNU vision 
  (which makes it a solution to the vendor lock-in problem for 
  webservices) may be refined, but not discarded.  There would need 
  to be structures in place which prevent people who do not agree 
  with these key things from "hijacking" DotGNU.  We would need to 
  have a constitution which defines some democratic institutions and 
  their responsibilities, as well as procedures for selecting the 
  members and the leaders of these institutions, as all as some 
  principles which the democratic institutions cannot change without 
  the approval of the sponsoring organizations (FreeDevelopers and 
  the GNU project.)  Setting this all up in a way that actually works 
  will require a lot of effort, as well as trial-and-error.  Doing 
  this here in DotGNU would be a huge distraction, which we cannot 
  afford.<br><br>

  So what DotGNU needs is a simpler structure that will still give
  us most or all of the benefits of a constitutional democracy.  We
  have established such a structure, as follows:<br><br>

  1. DotGNU has a GNU-appointed Steering Committee.<br><br>

  2. However this Steering Committee does not have things under
     control.  The Steering Committee guides the DotGNU process
     by making recommendations to the projects.  (Example:  The
     "DotGNU projects list" is such a _recommendation_ document.  It
     is not meant to prevent people from working on things that are
     not on the list.)<br><br>

  3. Most actual decisions are made in the development projects.
     Each project has a leader who establishes a decision-making
     process.  This does not need to be a democratic process,
     because projects which make bad decisions can be forked.
     (This possibility of forking makes mismanagement much
     less likely to happen, and hence there will probably not
     be a need for many forks.)<br><br>

  4. Mailing lists have been established for facilitating a free
     flow of discussions on various matters related to DotGNU.
     Use of the lists in ways which harm the DotGNU project will
     not be tolerated.  Here are some examples of behavior which
     will not be tolerated:<br>
     - making FUD-like claims without substantiating them upon request<br>
     - "name calling"<br>
     - advertising or recommending proprietary software in any way<br>
     - making postings which seem to be illegal according to the
       laws of the country where the mailing list server is located
       (currently the USA).<br>
     People who do such or similar things may be moderated,
     kicked off the list, or banned.  The offending postings may
     be removed from the list's archives.<br>

<h3>Licensing issues</h3>

<strong><a name="3.00">3.00 What software licenses does DotGNU use?</a></strong><br><br>

  All official software development projects of the DotGNU
  meta-project use the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).
  For Libraries which are intended to be linked with third-party
  programs that may not have a GPL-compatible license, as a special
  exception such linking is allowed.<br><br>


<strong><a name="3.01">3.01 Does the linking exception carry over to derivative works?</a></strong><br><br>

  If you create a derivative work of pnetlib or any library which is
  licensed as "GPL plus linking exception", then it is up to you
  whether want the linking exception to carry over to your derivative
  work.  If you leave the exception in the text, then it applies to
  your version.<br><br>


<strong><a name="3.02">3.02 What about programs which access each other through network</a>
  protocols.  Is that a form of linking?</strong><br><br>

  No.  A GPL'd program can use any kind of webservice regardless
  of how the webservice software is licensed, and GPL'd webservice
  software can be used by any program regardless of that program's
  license.<br><br>

<strong><a name="3.03">3.03 Is it possible to establish strong copyleft for webservices,</a>
  that allows them to be used only by Free Software?</strong><br><br>

  It is probably not possible to construct a Free Software license
  (which operates through copyright law) which would have this 
  effect.<br><br>

<strong><a name="3.04">3.04 Why don't you use the LGPL for libraries?</a></strong><br><br>

  Using GPL plus linking exception has several advantages.  One 
  is that this makes it more convenient to reuse parts of the code
  (possibly with modification) in GPL-licensed files.<br><br>

  Also, you can exclude native methods from the linking exception.
  This is done in the license on the C# library, "pnetlib", which
  is distributed under these terms:<br><br>

     The source code for the library is distributed under the
     terms of the GNU General Public License, with the following
     exception: if you link this library against your own
     program, then you do not need to release the source code
     for that program. However, any changes that you make to the
     library itself, or to any native methods upon which the
     library relies, must be re-distributed in accordance with
     the terms of the GPL. <br><br>

  We call this the "GPL plus linking exception", which is also
  used by the GNU Classpath project.<br><br>

  We aren't trying to restrict the use of the library by any kind of
  commercial entities.  However, a proprietary software company 
  could produce their own proprietary runtime engine that has
  "enhanced" native method support of some kind. Under the 
  terms of the LGPL, they would be obligated to release the
  declaration of the native method in the C# system library. For
  example:<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;extern int enhanced_method(string arg1, int arg2); <br><br>

  But would they be obligated to release the source code to the
  native method's implementation under the terms of the LGPL?
  Because it is in a separate program (their runtime engine), it
  isn't strictly part of the library. The result would be a C#
  library that is useless without their proprietary native method
  implementation. This state of affairs is undesirable.<br><br>

  Under the terms of the GPL, we can require that the source 
  code to native methods must also be available, or the library
  modification is disallowed.<br><br>

  This is why we have decided to use the GPL with the linking
  exception described above.<br><br>

  [Aside: by "native method" we mean any method that is
  implemented in something other than IL bytecode. This 
  includes PInvoke functions and "internalcall" methods, 
  among others.]<br><br>
