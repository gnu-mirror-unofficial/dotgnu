<h1>
 DotGNU Software Development Projects
</h1>
<p>
 The <a href="index.html">DotGNU vision</a> is so big that for
 practical reasons DotGNU must be organized as a meta-project
 that serves as an umbrella for at least ten to twenty 
 software development projects.
</p>
<p>
 There are two main tracks of development of DotGNU, each of which can
 have any number of DotGNU projects.  New projects can be proposed and
 discussed at any time, as explained on the
 <a href="proposals/">proposals page</a>.
</p>
<h2>
 DotGNU Platform
</h2>
<p>
 This webservices platform will support p2p communication between
 multiple webservices servers, so that they can keep their databases in
 synch.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>
   DotGNU Portable.NET
  </strong>
  <p>
   For strategic reasons, the DotGNU Platform must be "downward
   compatible" to Microsoft's .NET, in the sense that programs
   ("Portable Executables") that have been created for .NET must
   run on the DotGNU platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   The DotGNU project that is responsible for ensuring this
   compatibility is the 
   <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">DotGNU
   Portable.NET</a> project led by Rhys Weatherley.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is a high-priority project.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Support for Java bytecode
  </strong>
  <p>
   The invention of the new language C# is a strategic move of
   Microsoft against the successful Java language.  (It seems that
   Microsoft wants to fight against everything that is successful
   and not under the control of Microsoft).  DotGNU wants to support
   Java and the various languages that can be compiled to Java
   bytecode, so we need a JVM implementation for the DotGNU Platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maybe this will be implemented as part of the pnet package.
  </p>
  <p>
   This isn't actively being worked on yet.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   DotGNU Secure Execution Environment
  </strong>
  <p>
   Portable Executables that come in one of the multiple bytecode
   formats supported by the DotGNU platform will be executed in a
   <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu-see/">DotGNU
   Secure Execution Environment.</a>  In order to facilitate remote
   execution, this will probably implemented as a daemon, and there
   is code for a test daemon called Andromeda which demonstrated how
   plugins can be bound to the daemon.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is a high-priority project.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   DotGNU Distributed Execution Environment
  </strong>
  <p>
   DotGNU's Distributed Execution Environment will be like an
   operating system for a "distributed computer" consisting of
   several instances of the "DotGNU Secure Execution Environment"
   that are running on several computers.  This system must be able
   to take care of replicating databases across all the parts of this
   "distributed computer" and propagating updates.
  <p>
   This isn't actively being worked on yet.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>
 DotGNU Virtual Identities
</h2>
<p>
 This will be a totally decentralized authentication / personal
 information system that can compete with Microsoft's "Passport"
 system.  This system will eventually implemented as an application
 that runs on the DotGNU platform.  Unlike other applications it makes
 sense to develop this application under the umbrella of the DotGNU
 meta-project, because authentication is also an essential component of
 every operating system.
</p>
<p>
 There are several active projects in this area, but none of them is
 officially part of the GNU project yet.  They're listed on the
 <a href="proposals/active.html">Active Proposals page</a>.
