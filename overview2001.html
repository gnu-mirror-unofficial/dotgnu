<p>Recently, on the DotGNU developer's mailing list a member proposed that 
 "DotGNU" should be interpreted as a recursive acronym (like GNU stands for 
 "GNU's Not Unix"); so, perhaps someday, "DotGNU" will really mean something 
 akin to "DotGNU over the GNU Networking Universe". Even today the DotGNU 
project and members are building an "operating system for the Internet" - 
a collection of tools that allow software components to interact with each 
other over the Internet.</p>

<p>From the beginning, we have been concerned that Microsoft's probable intention 
 with .NET is to ensnare and entrap developers.  There can be no doubt that 
 this unscrupulous proprietary software company wants to extend their effective
  desktop OS monopoly to encompass the Authentication, Authorization, and
Virtual  Identity systems on the Internet.  One of the main objectives of
the DotGNU project is to prevent that takeover by providing tools for webservices
 without <i>vendor lock-in</i> of any kind. The "Webservices Ethics" department
 would like to draw attention to these articles, which reflect our aims and
intentions:</p>

    Article 1:   DotGNU Portable.NET (with its C# compiler, runtime and related 
 development tools)</p>
       
<p style="margin-left: 60%;">by Portable.NET lead developer<br>
   Rhys Weatherley</p>
    </div>
       
<p>The Portable.NET project was begun in January 2001, with the goal of building 
 a runtime engine, a C# compiler, and the C# system library. Early on, I realized
that much of the infrastructure needed for a runtime  engine was identical
to the code needed for a C# compiler.  In particular,  the metadata reading
and writing routines in the runtime engine could also  be used as the internal
class representation for the compiler. From this early core, the assembler,
disassembler, and the other development tools quickly emerged.  At this point,
the runtime engine, the compiler, and the C# library were still in an embryonic
form.  The C# library was split out of the "pnet" tree into "pnetlib" specifically
so it could be reused by other projects.</p>
                
<p>Around late April, the C# compiler clearly was becoming a  problem to maintain.
 The level of complexity was so great that bugs kept  creeping into the code.
 I had used similar designs on previous compiler projects,  and had also
had problems with complexity.  My design was technically correct,  but the
sheer number of details kept sinking the code.  So I went back to  the drawing
board to rethink the design and to perform some research. The result was
the "treecc" tool, which provides an aspect-oriented approach to building
compilers.  The complexity that once caused so many problems was now trivial
to handle. </p>
   
<p>The C# compiler was re-written in early July and was a marked improvement.
  I also discovered that using the treecc framework to support languages
other than C#, and bytecode formats other than IL, was very easy too.  Support 
for compiling C# to the JVM and for compiling Java to IL should be released 
in early-2002.</p>
          
<p>Portable.NET and DotGNU merged in August.  A lot of progress was made on
the core infrastructure, the pnetlib C# library, and the C# compiler.  But
the runtime engine was still lagging behind. The polymorphic nature of the
instruction set was making building an efficient engine very difficult .</p>
            
<p>I began work on another background research project to devise a new engine. 
  This culminated in the "Converted Virtual Machine" (CVM) in October 2001: 
 a radically new design for bytecode interpreters.  Instead of interpreting 
 the difficult IL instructions directly, the bytecode is converted into another
  instruction set that can be interpreted efficiently. One of the major benefits
 of the new engine design is that&nbsp; JITs can be easily supported in the 
future.  CVM itself is essentially a "bytecode JIT".  Most of the hard work 
is already done, which should make writing a native JIT a fairly simple task.</p>
        
<p>At the end of 2001, Portable.NET had reached the stage of being able to 
 run simple example programs, and even a few complex ones such as the "Curse 
 of Frogger" video game.</p>
        
<p>The biggest area to be dealt with in early 2002 is completing the C# compiler 
 and the C# library, and then beginning work on an x86 JIT.</p>
        
<p>From my own personal perspective, Portable.NET is interesting because 
of the research into language implementation techniques that has arisen from
 my work on the project.  I'm hoping to be able to "spin off" other tools,
like treecc, which are not only useful to Portable.NET, but are also useful
to other Free Software projects.</p>

    Article 2:   phpGroupWare (a collection of groupware applications which 
 can be used from any browser and also from other programs via XML-RPC).</p>
       
<p style="margin-left: 60%;">by phpGroupWare lead developer<br>

    </div>
        
<p>phpGroupWare is a web-based and web service for groupware applications. 
  The package includes all the standard PIM applications such as email, calendar, 
address-book,  todo list, and notes; and with the powerful, well defined and
easy to use  API we have developed, other applications can, and have been,
fully integrated. All  applications are optionally installed so that the
administrator can pick and choose  only the applications that meet the needs
of their users. Normally users  take advantage of the terrific web interface
from any browser on any platform  they choose; we adhere to pure HTML standards
as much as possible. The web interface is the most fully supported interface
to the applications  in phpGroupWare but not the only possible one.</p>
 
<p>With the use of the simple XML-RPC protocol, which we now support in phpGroupWare, 
developers and users can access the applications functionality and data from 
other applications. These applications  would need to be written in a language 
that supports XML-RPC, but that includes  most languages of which I am aware. 
This makes phpGroupWare a "web service" because it is offering up its functionality 
as a service to other applications. This gives developers and users alike 
great power and flexibility.</p>
        
<p>Web services are not the answer to all problems, but they open great 
possibilities for platform and language independence, as well as offering
greater opportunities to share code and functionality than ever before possible.
 The  possibilities are only becoming visible, but they <b>will</b> change
how applications  are developed from this point into the future.</p>
        
<p>By combining forces with DotGNU, we will be able to leverage our  collective 
knowledge and experience to develop outstanding applications and  services 
for users. DotGNU is focused, among other things, on authentication  services 
and platform independent bytecode solutions while the phpGroupWare  team focuses
on Groupware based solutions. When the two come together, phpGroupWare  will
use the Authentication services of DotGNU, and DotGNU will have real- world,
working, groupware webservices making use of their technology. Even  more
importantly, the phpGroupWare team is able to lend experience on subjects 
such as creating a universal preferences settings service, which will follow 
the DotGNU authentication services effort. phpGroupWare will immediately make
use of the DotGNU standards as they are released. We are providing DotGNU 
a great testing ground, while giving phpGroupWare the opportunity to influence 
what are sure to be important standards.</p>

<p>If done incorrectly it does.  The key question is how to protect privacy 
 and provide convenience for people that do not otherwise understand what 
they are surrendering thru convenience.  In the IDsec method, at least right 
at the start no single central authority has every users data; rather any 
number of profile providers can be providing it, including your own workstation,
  and on a selective and controlled basis.</p>
        
<p>However, this doesn't in itself prevent the possibility of collecting user
data in the way you speak of, as it happens already today.  If one goes to
site A and B, and happens to permit sharing of, say, a credit card number 
 with both, certainly sites A and B can form a common database keyed on the 
 common credit card and identify people that way.  Other kinds of data can 
 also be common keyed to try and match users between sites.</p>
       
<p>What IDsec does provide for, and in fact what we want in DotGNU, is that 
 no single entity will have a master database of every user and hence one 
cannot form a single master common keyed database of everyone that can be 
sold to other commercial entities directly.  Since separate and unique session 
keys are used, unless common and unique identifying data (like say a credit 
card # or ssn) is being permitted to be shared, there is no direct way to 
determine that user "X" visiting site "A" is also user "Y" visiting site "B".
 In IDsec there is direct user control of what data is shared and with whom,
and used correctly, one can prevent correlative data from being shared if
one uses it purely for session identity so when I visit site "A" I simply 
 tell it I am the same "X" I was last time and share no data at all and have 
the simple convenience of no login and single global sign-on.  Used this way
it does not tell anyone that "A" presented to site "X" is also "B" on site
"Y".  One can also keep multiple profiles, including anonymous ones, and
choose which identity to use when visiting a given site.  Of course, it does
not prevent or protect users who do share correlative data, but neither does
manual entry in today's world except thru the occasional typo.</p>
       
<p>IDsec is certainly not perfect, and may require some thought to use in 
 a way that does protect privacy fully, but it is a far better solution than 
 those otherwise being pushed for today. There are things we may wish to change
 in IDsec to make it better for privacy, but it is at least seems a reasonable
 starting point.</p>

<p>Yes. IDsec seems to be on the right track. The question is not should all
that information be accumulated, but by whom. I should have all the information 
 about me on my machine. Others should only have parts. And I think IDsec 
allows this. In fact, for those who know some accounting, the system should 
be like double entry accounting. I have all my information because I deal 
with everyone, but they only have the other side of the transaction that I
did with them.</p>
        
<p>This is important, because I have all my information, but more importantly, 
 I can <i>check</i> everyone else's information about me. If I don't have 
the information  on my machine, I have no way of knowing what others have 
on me, or be able  to correct errors that they may have made.</p>

<p>IDsec certainly does allow this, where you can have complete information 
 on yourself on your machine, and others have incomplete but factually correct 
 information as you permitted to share and which you control the update and 
 correction of.  It's original intent, however, was clearly to enable the 
creation of internet identity providers as third parties; that the individual 
 can be such a third party is almost a side-effect of their original design 
:).</p>
        
<p>As I said, IDsec is certainly not perfect, but it is close to or can be 
 made to do what we envisioned.  As free software we will be able to influence 
 it's better aspects.  One such way would be to make it fairly easy and painless 
 for any user to setup their own identity service.  That being said, I am 
not opposed in principle to the existence of third parties that wish to aggregate 
 users and offer identity services so long as anyone can commercially offer 
 such services, companies can provide it to shield their employee information 
 from such third parties if they choose, and there is the ultimate choice 
of being my own identity service.</p>
        
<p>That it can enable commercial providers of identity services will provide 
 incentives for commercial interests to adopt it over solutions that they 
would have no control over.  That a bank or financial institution can securely 
provide identity to their existing customer base rather than put it in the 
hands of a third party is a compelling selling point for them.  In this respect, 
 I see IDsec as potentially interesting because it can successfully align 
many commercial interests with our own ethical ones.</p>

<p>Yes. Agreed.</p>
       
<p>I think that most people will opt for a commercial provider, which they 
 should be free to do. And yes, banks are a natural candidate.  They are already
 really just data centers; it just happens to be financial data. But this
is also why they are deathly afraid of losing control. MS called them dinosaurs
 a few years back (which really is right), and they are now afraid of any
loss of control of their data and guard it with their life. (One reason e-banking
 is moving so slowly). But they will eventually have to join a system and
it might as well be ours.</p>
        
<p>I still suggest that we provide local backup capacities on the personal 
 machines, even if people opt for commercial providers, otherwise they will 
 be subject to lock-in. So while a commercial provider may be a live repository, 
 everyone should have a backup on their own machine to protect/check their 
 data and so they can change providers easily.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>What are webservices good for?               
    <p>   When a program is implemented as a "webservice", the functionality 
 can be used by other programs, which can be   implemented in any programming 
 language, and which can be run on   any computer connected to the Internet. 
Multiple users in different parts  of   the world can potentially interact 
with a single dataset.</p>
     </li>
     <li>How do you define "webservice"?               
    <p> "Webservices" are any services that are offered on the web   (regardless 
 of what technology is used to provide them).</p>
                   
    <p>In order to turn this statement into an actual definition,  these explanations
need to be added:</p>
                   
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>With "service" we mean not only that some functionality is      
provided,  but that there should also be some description of       this functionality, 
 namely how the service should be used       and what it provides.</li>
     <li>With saying that the service is "offered on the web" we       mean 
 that it's offered on the internet via standard       protocols, i.e. protocols 
 that are open, widely published,       and freely available for anyone to 
 implement.<br>
           <br>
        It is sometimes useful to distinguish between "webservice    components", 
 which are meant to be used by other webservices,    and "webservice applications", 
 which are meant to be used by    humans directly.  Both "webservice components"
and    "webservice applications" are "webservices" as defined above.<br>
         <br>
       </li>
                   
    </ol>
    </li>
     <li>What about other definitions of "webservice"?<br>
       <br>
      A definition attempt by the Stencil Group has been discussed in some
   detail on the DotGNU developers mailing list, in these messages:     
          
    <ol style="list-style-type: square;">

    </ol>
    </li>
     <li>Are webservices "the future", or will something better be invented 
 soon?<br>
       <br>
    Who knows? Webservices may become the   preferred  way to implement all 
kinds of intranet- and Internet-based computer  applications, for the following 
  reasons:                
    <ol style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>Loose coupling between components: Each component can be     implemented 
 in the preferred programming language of the     implementors of that component, 
 regardless of what languages     and development tools have been used to 
implement other     components.  There is less organizational overhead to 
develop     changes or enhancements to various components in parallel.</li>
    <li>Rapid prototyping and an easy transition from prototype to     production: 
 Prototypes of webservice components can be     conveniently implemented in
 scripting languages like Perl,     Python or PHP.  The transition to production
 will typically     include moving the component to a different server (or
     several load-balanced servers) and possibly also a more     efficient
 re-implementation of the component.<br>
         <br>
       </li>
                   
    </ol>
    </li>
     <li>Is the data stored on the webservice server?                   
                
    <p>Data can be stored either locally or on the webservice server.   If 
 multiple users need to interact with the same set of data,   then the data 
should  be stored on the webservice server. This raises the legitimate concern
of whether a webservice   provide  can "lock in" customers by making &nbsp;access
to their data inconvenient or   impossible. This issue is   addressed in
the following questions.</p>
 
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
     <li>Can we move to a different webservice provider?                
        <p>The DotGNU webservice server requires that for each webservice
  and  each set of data that each service acts upon, there is an "owner of
the   data" who has  the right to download the entire set of data   together
with the program that implements the webservice.   Program which have been
downloaded in this way can be executed   in any DotGNU Secure Execution Environment
on a desktop   computer or on a DotGNU webservices server.</p>
                   
        <p>This means that when there is a need for an application to use
  data from multiple sources, where no-one has ownership rights   to all
the data, then the application must be divided into   multiple webservice
components.</p>
     </li>
     <li>Can we get source code for the webservice programs?            
   
        <p>If all of the following conditions are met, then the webservice
  provider is required to distribute the source code for the   webservice
program to you, upon your request:</p>
                   
        <ol style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>The webservice program has been licensed to the webservice     provider 
 under the terms of the GNU General Public License,     or it is a derivative 
 work of such a program.</li>
    <li>The webservice program runs on a DotGNU webservice server.</li>
    <li>You are recognized as an "owner of the data" for this webservice:
 the webservice server will upon your request distribute   the program to
you in binary form.  According the terms of the   GNU General  Public License,
this implies that the webservice   provider must upon request  distribute
the source code for the   webservice program to you.<br>

      </li>
     <li>Am I obligated to give away my webservice source code?         
     
        <p>You are <i><b>not </b></i>automatically obligated to distribute
your source   code,  and you are certainly <i><b>not </b></i>obligated to
just give it away.   However, if you  sell webservice services, then your
customers   will expect that you make  them the "owner of the data" that
the webservice uses, and depending on  the exact circumstances   that may
indirectly give these customers a right  to get the   source code upon request.
 Here are the details:</p>
                   
        <p>If you provide a webservice using a GPL'd webservice program 
 (which  you may have modified), then the "owner of the data"   will be able
to obtain  the webservices programs under the terms   of the GNU GPL, and
this implies  in particular that they will   have a right to get the source
code of the  exact version of the   program which you're using.  The terms
of the GNU GPL also   require you to make a written promise to this "owner
of the   data" that you will be willing to provide the source code upon 
 request.  This ensures that the "owner of the data" will know   about this
right to the source code.</p>
                   
        <p>The "owner of the data" is typically a paying customer, and the
  fact that the customer has a right to get the source code   increases the 
value of the service you provide.  Therefore you   will be able to charge 
a higher price and/or close more sales.</p>
                   
        <p>You can use the DotGNU development tools to program your own 
 webservices  (instead of just modifying the webservice programs   which
are distributed  with DotGNU, or which others have made   available under
the GNU GPL) and  then your are not required to   make source code for these
webservices available  to the   customer who is the "owner of the data".
 However, even in   these  situations where you are not required to make
the source   code available  to your customers, we strongly encourage you
to   provide the source code  to your customers under the terms of   the
GNU GPL anyway.  We believe that  this is ethically the   right thing to
do, and that it will be good for your  business.</p>

<p>The introduction of the DotGNU project on the FreeDevelopers mailing list 
 back in June of 2001 brought many arguments.  People wondered what value 
the project would bring to the GNU/Linux world and shuddered at the thought
of dealing  with Microsoft-founded technologies.  Many people even wondered
if the project  would inadvertently help Microsoft.  In the time since the
idea first surfaced, the discussions refined the idea until a founding philosophy
was designed.   Our goals were not simply compatibility with the Microsoft
platform, we decided almost right away that there was an obligation to create
a webservices framework that would ensure that the freedom of the members
of our community  would be protected.  If our work helped the proprietary
companies of the world to subjugate the members of our community, then the
project would have been for nothing. As a consequence, the project leaders
mandated that the protection of freedom was a key aspect of the DotGNU project.</p>
        
<p>"Webservices" is the new buzzword.  Every tech-writer is writing about 
 webservices when they talk about the future of the technological world.
 The question  is: where do these new webservices fit into the larger picture?
 If you're  to believe some people: webservices are the future and the standard
method  of running programs is defunct.  If you're to believe others: webservices
  are a fad and no one will ever use them.  As with most tech prognostication, 
 both predictions will most likely be partly true.  The fact of the matter
is that the  success of network services (webmail, etc...) is already happening
and these  services are complimenting the computer usage of people every
day.  This has been the case been for some time as well.  To allow this market
to be overtaken by a proprietary vendor would be unthinkable. So, we must
embrace the world the way it is, and create a Free framework with which webservices 
and larger network service enabled applications can be easily constructed, 
thus allowing for competition in the marketplace, security, freedom, and
privacy.</p>

<p>DotGNU is in part concerned with producing bytecode runtime systems for 
 portable executables, and of course, we are interested in the ECMA "standardized" 
 bytecode system and creating a freely licensed and fully portable implementation 
 as represented by the Portable.NET project.  Having a portable and universally 
 interoperable runtime for developing and delivering web hosted applications 
 represents an important part of DotGNU, as does extending support to other 
 existing bytecode systems such as Java.</p>
        
<p>Another part of DotGNU is concerned with providing a fully valid and technically 
 correct solution for authentication and user identities that provide the 
convenience of internet-wide single sign-on services without the need to deliberately
handicap such systems thru a single vendor point of failure or implement
such a solution in a manner that forces users to compromise personal data
or which compromises the integrity of commercial organizations.  Certainly
there is neither any technical merit nor commercial reason to have one and
only one source of authentication and identity services on the Internet.</p>
        
<p>While enabling the existence and use of multiple trusted third party identity 
 services is quite valid and useful commercially when such services can be 
 hosted on a non-discriminatory basis by any organization wishing to do so 
 in a free and open market, rather than by either a single vendor or a small 
 group of privileged vendors, ideally we wish it to be possible for an individual 
 user to provide identity and personal data services directly from corporate 
 offices or even their own workstation if so desired to protect their personal 
 data to the fullest.</p>
        
<p>Tying together authentication, identity, and runtime, are meaningful services, 
 and DotGNU also will produce useful web hosted application services that 
will demonstrate the full cycle of authenticated single login in a secure 
manner with personal data that can be kept private and secure or hosted by 
trusted third parties and using the Portable.NET runtime to deliver these 
 services where they involve local execution on your workstation, all using 
freely licensed software under the GPL and hosted on freely licensed operating 
systems, such as GNU/Linux.</p>

    <li style="margin-top: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">AppServer</span><br>
    An application server based on CIL/C# is needed. It will take     more
 time as we need to complete C# corelibs. Now the question is,  should we
restrict AppServer to C#?  Can  we add other existing AppServers to DotGNU
?  A few choices are Zope, Webware,  eZPublish, phpCMS.  Will they be interested
in joining?</li>
    <li style="margin-top: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">WebServicesDevelopmentFrameWork</span><br>
    A set of libraries for common web service standards is a     major component 
 in this. Most AppSevers now have xml-rpc or     SOAP support. Some even support
 WSDL. SandStorm may be a  good addition to DotGNU in this regard.</li>
    <li style="margin-top: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">CommonServices</span><br>
    Identity is the first component. IDSec, macs, FrePort, etcetera comes 
here.      Groupware comes next (solved by phpGroupWare).  Another major 
   one  is ERP system available as webservice. GNUe should join     DotGNU, 
or DotGNU  should work on a webservice plugin for GNUe.</li>

<p>The Internet came to life at the rim when it dropped the idea of a central 
 server.  The forces of government and finance wish to pull power back to 
the center and regain control.  The pressure to things like ASP's, subscription/teathered 
 software, and server centric webservices are manifestations of this today 
 and reveal their strategy.  DotGNU seems to me to be the incubator of the
  LibreSoftware alternative.  That's why I'm here.</p>

<p>DotGNU is of particular interest to me and I was honored to be put on the
Steering Committee this year.  DotGNU has the potential to bring together 
 years of work in programming language integration research, and marry it 
beautifully with web services. I have in the past worked on using the Java 
Virtual Machine as a language integration platform, thus I am excited that 
DotGNU's Portable.NET might make true language integration possible.<br>

<p>If everyone uses webservices, and these programs use Microsoft's centralized 
 auth system, then secret services and other crackers can easily observe how
 anyone is using their PC. This could far too easily become the foundation 
 of a "Big Brother" type totalitarian system.  Microsoft is a Goliath.  From 
 the beginning of DotGNU I have felt somewhat like a David challenging this
  Goliath, doing what needs to be done, in the name of Jesus.  Yes, I believe 
 that for DotGNU to be successful, we need to have God on our side.</p>

<p>DotGNU has the potential of solving a number of problems that currently 
 keep developers in the habit of creating programs for That Other Platform. 
  We could create a unified, cross-system compatible and completely interoperable 
 development environment for multiple language development.  This would be 
 a boon for the entire development industry and would solve many potential
  program availability issues that currently keep GNU/Linux from becoming
ubiquitous in the market.  This aspect provides a unique opportunity to place
Free Software at the forefront of the industry if we take our steps wisely.
 Interoperability truly is king, but we must do more than interoperate. 
We must create the  best Dam*ed development environment that ever existed.
 In the long run, this is our mandate.  We must, along with the rest of the
Free Software world, do what it takes to dethrone the proprietary forces
of the world.</p>

<p>DotGNU was the first free software project I have associated
with. The thing I like about DotGNU is that it is not simply a
.NET clone, period. IMHO this is a free (as in speech!), secure
and portable webservice framework. Then why add C# support ?.
Well, we have to follow ECMA/IEEE standards even when they are
proposed by a monopolist. But we have taken the high road where
most would have preferred the easier one, to ensure that our work
remains free for the future (read:bootstrapping off gcc).  It's
been a tough year for DotGNU but it has not been without its
rewards. We have gained new allies in this war for freedom like
the phpgroupware team. ("join up" ,they said, "it's a man's
life".)</p>

<p>It's kudos to all the developers of DotGNU. Thanks to them ,

<p>I have been working with phpGroupWare since its inception as the project 
 leader. I have had several years of experience as a groupware administrator 
 of all three of the big commercial groupware servers and felt that all of 
 them lacked in some way or another. When phpGroupWare started I knew that 
 I could help build a groupware server that did not have all the failings 
of the commercial products in both features and lack of freedom. By helping 
build both the code and the community I feel that my efforts have been a tremendous
success. phpGroupWare is a powerful, flexible and *free* product that can
meet and exceed the needs of many many people. When I became aware of web
services and realized their potential I immediately started to push phpGroupWare
in that direction because I knew that web services would change the rules,
and I wanted to be there. Our code has so easily been adapted and continues
to be a perfect testing ground for new technology that I know we have built
something to be proud of, and I believe the DotGNU team has show great vision
and wisdom in including us into their team. I believe phpGroupWare and DotGNU
can be successful and offer the world top rate applications and services
without giving up freedom or features.</p>

<p>There were many things that concerned me when I first heard about DotGNU. 
  Of course, like many others at the time, I was highly skeptical of such 
an enterprise until I took the time to think deeper on the subject.  There 
are those that say that DotGNU helps legitimize ".NET" services from Microsoft. 
  I believe Java already does this very well.  The problem Java faces is that
 Sun does not wish to relinquish control to certain parts of it, just as
Microsoft  chooses not to relinquish control to parts of it's so called ".NET"
technologies,  especially in regards to authentication and web services.</p>
        
<p>Neither situation is valid or useful for web centric free software to progress.
 To create software on a non-free infrastructure (Java) is problematic even
if the resulting software itself can be freely licensed.  Worst still would
be to create a free infrastructure or runtime that integrates with proprietary
 services and protocols, as the latter, while free on the surface, can be
used to lock out any other vendor solutions at the key middleware services
level and in fact could be used to effectively block free software development
by changing licensing on key services and protocols that may later be required.
  While it's easy to pretend that these things will not happen or will never
 be adopted by others, the fact remains that burying one's head in the sand
 will not make the problem go away.</p>
        
<p>DotGNU is about assuring freedom, for both developers and users. In this 
 sense, I, among others, understood it was necessary to look at and engage 
 in the full spectrum of services, from basic runtime to web services and 
protocols, and to do so in a manner that protects the integrity of user's 
private data.  This was why I chose to become part of DotGNU, because I thought 
it was far better to do something than simply ignore the problem and hope 
it would simply go away...</p>
