<H4>Summary</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Implemented by classes that require explicit control over resource cleanup.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Description</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Objects that need to free resources that cannot safely be reclaimed by the
      garbage collector implement the <A HREF="IDisposable.html" TARGET="contents">IDisposable</A> interface. <P>

It is a version breaking change to add the <A HREF="IDisposable.html" TARGET="contents">IDisposable</A> interface to an existing class, as it
   changes the semantics of the class. <P>

[<I>Note</I>: <A HREF="IDisposable.html" TARGET="contents">IDisposable</A> contains the System.IDisposable.Dispose method. The consumer of an object should 
call this method when the object is no longer needed. The <A HREF="IDisposable.html" TARGET="contents">IDisposable</A> interface is generally provided for the
release of unmanaged resources that need to be reclaimed in some order or time
dependent manner. It is important to note that the actual release of these
resources happens at the first call to System.IDisposable.Dispose for
any given object that supports this interface. Programmers should take care
to pair the creation of objects that implement <CODE>IDisposable</CODE>
 with
at most one invocation of the <CODE>Dispose</CODE>
 method. Though it
is legal to invoke <CODE>Dispose</CODE>
 more than once, if this happens it
might indicate the presence of a bug since such an object is usually rendered
otherwise unusable after the first <CODE>Dispose</CODE>
 invocation. ]<P>

<H4>Summary</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Performs application-defined tasks associated with
      freeing or resetting resources.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Description</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Note</I>: This method is, by convention, used for all tasks associated with freeing
         resources held by an object, or preparing an object for reuse. <P>

When implementing the System.IDisposable.Dispose method, objects should seek to ensure
      that all held resources are freed by propagating the call through the
      containment hierarchy. For example, if an object A allocates an object B, and B
      allocates an object C, then A&apos;s System.IDisposable.Dispose implementation should call
   System.IDisposable.Dispose on B,
      which should in turn call System.IDisposable.Dispose on C. Objects should also call the
   System.IDisposable.Dispose method
      of their base class if the base class implements <A HREF="IDisposable.html" TARGET="contents">IDisposable</A>.<P>

If an object&apos;s System.IDisposable.Dispose method is called more than once, the object should
   ignore all calls after the first one. The object should not throw an exception
   if its System.IDisposable.Dispose
   method is called multiple times. System.IDisposable.Dispose can throw an exception if an error
   occurs because a resource has already been freed and
System.IDisposable.Dispose had 
   not been called previously. <P>

A resource type might use a particular convention to denote an allocated state
   versus a freed state. An example of this is stream classes, which are
   traditionally thought of as open or closed. Classes that have such conventions
   might choose to implement a public method with a customized name, which calls the
System.IDisposable.Dispose 
method. <P>

Because the System.IDisposable.Dispose method must be called explicitly, objects that implement
<A HREF="IDisposable.html" TARGET="contents">IDisposable</A> 
should also implement a finalizer to handle freeing resources when
System.IDisposable.Dispose is not 
called. By default, the garbage collector will automatically call an object&apos;s
finalizer prior to reclaiming its memory. However, once the
System.IDisposable.Dispose method 
has been called, it is typically unnecessary and/or undesirable for the garbage
collector to call the disposed object&apos;s finalizer. To prevent automatic
finalization, System.IDisposable.Dispose implementations can call System.GC.SuppressFinalize(System.Object). For
additional information on implementing finalizers, see <A HREF="GC.html" TARGET="contents">GC</A> and System.Object.Finalize.<P>

<H4>Example</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Resource classes should follow the pattern illustrated by
      this example:<P>

<PRE>class ResourceWrapper : BaseType, IDisposable {
  // Pointer to a external resource.
  private int handle; 
  private OtherResource otherRes; //Other resource you use.
  private bool disposed = false;

  public ResourceWrapper () {
    handle = //Allocate on the unmanaged side.
    otherRes = new OtherResource (...);
  }
  // Free your own state.
  private void freeState () {
    if (!disposed) {
       CloseHandle (handle);
       dispose = true;
    }
  }

  // Free your own state, call dispose on all state you hold, 
  // and take yourself off the Finalization queue.
  public void Dispose () {
    freeState ();
    OtherRes.Dispose();
    // If base type implements dispose, call it.
    base.Dispose(); 
    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);  
  }

  // Free your own state (not other state you hold) 
  // and give your base class a chance to finalize. 
  ~ResourceWrapper (){
     freeState();
  }
}
   </PRE>
