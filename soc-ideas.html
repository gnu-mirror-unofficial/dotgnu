<h3><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/dotgnu/">DotGNU ideas list: Summer of Code</a></h3>

The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/dotgnu/">DotGNU</a> project
is a Free Software implementation of the .NET and Mono platforms and
spans many different programming areas: from low-level tasks like code
generators to compilers, to class libraries and GUI applications.
<p>

The Portable .NET implements Just-In-Time compilation
functionality. Unlike other JIT's, libJIT (a reusable JIT library) is
designed to be independent of any particular virtual machine bytecode
format or language. If you run Portable .NET on a machine for which a
native code generator is not yet available, then Portable .NET will
fall back to interpreting the code.

Read <a
href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/doc/libjit/libjit_1.html#SEC1">the
libjit rationale</a> for instruction and rationale for the DotGNU JIT
Library (libJIT).

<ol>
<li>Add ahead-of-time compilation support in libJIT (Complexity: medium-high)
<p>
The libJIT library contains routines that permit pre-compiling JIT'ed
functions to an on-disk representation. This representation can be
loaded at some future time, to avoid the overhead of compiling the
functions at runtime.
We use the ELF format for this purpose, which is a common binary format used by modern operating systems and compilers.

<li>Port libJIT to a new architecture or improve existing architecture support (Complexity: medium-high)<br>
<p>
You could port libJIT to a new architecture, for example OpenRISC,
SPARC, MIPSEL and so on or improve an existing code generator (x86, arm...).
The <a
href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/doc/libjit/libjit_19.html#SEC37">libJIT
manual</a> describes the steps needed to for porting libJIT to new
architectures. 

<li>Enhance the libJIT interpreter (Complexity: medium)<br>
<p>
LibJIT includes an interpreter for running code on platforms that
don't have a native code generator yet. This reduces the need for
programmers to write their own interpreters for such platforms.
Essentially, this project means making the regression tests with 'make
check' in the Portable .NET directory work with the interpreter.

<li>Enhance libJIT optimization (Complexity: medium-high)<br>
<p>
For example, implement inlining, enhance constant propagation or
dead-code elimination.

<li>Work on memory leaks, implement a special feature in the Garbage Collector. (Complexity: high)<br>
<p>
It would be beneficial to have a method in GC which can enumerate all
objects which reference a specified object.  The signature of this
method might be, for example, <code>object[] GC.GetReferences( object
o )</code>.

<li>Fill the gaps in Portable.NET's System.Windows.Forms (Complexity: medium)<br>
<p>
The Portable .NET Windows.Froms library implements much of .NET 1.1,
but some classes are still missing.

<li>Replacing CIL with native code. (Complexity: high)<br>
<p>
DotGNU contains a code generator that can be used for Just-in-Time
compilation at runtime.  Code can also be compiled ahead of time to
produce native code before it's needed. The goal is to modify the runtime
and compilation so that the bytecodes can be safely removed from a program
and a single image is shipped containing both metadata and native code.

<li>Implement generics or any other C# 2.0, 3.0 feature. (Complexity: very high)<br>
<p>
The Portable .NET C# compiler is based on the <a
href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/treecc_doc/treecc_toc.html">treecc</a>
tool.

<li>C# bindings for Allegro (Complexity: medium-high)<br>
<p>
This includes not only being able to call Allegro functions from C#, but
also being able to do so in a way which 'feels natural' for the C#
language.
