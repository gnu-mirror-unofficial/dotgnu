This document is a general idea on what the basic API for the DotGNU
platform would be. It would be what I would consider the most minimal
set's of API that should be accessible by DotGNU platform programs. I
would also consider other things which might be of importance in the
appendix, some of these might not be directly related to the API,
however I would consider important to mention.</P>

DotGNU is both a framework and an platform. Programs can either use
one or both parts (hence allowing flexibility). A program using the
framework may not be a native DotGNU application, so these programs
can use the native O.s.'s API. However a program using the DotGNU
platform does not have the luxury of having accessible OS' API
routines, or objects.</P>

Posix, I think should be our primary low level API for the DotGNU
platform, this includes threads and what ever Posix specifies. Why
Posix? Well its a mature API, and most importantly it's widely
adopted. Although at the moment I am only aware of POSIX 1, and POSIX
Threads.</P>

Another API we should be able to support is GTK, now why not Gnome,
well Gnome is a desktop, and not appropriate for windowing. However I
think that DotGNU should also support another Widget layer on top of
GTK on the Platform side, which should be easier to program on
compared to GTK.</P>

DotGNU Framework API calls. This is crucial as this allows access to
remote objects and services (this includes both the Registry and RLS

Full UNIX Sockets, I don't know if this is specified in POSIX,
however this should be available for the Platform, as not everybody
may want to use the DotGNU framework</P>

Component Interfaces. Well this could mean several things, however it
should be noted that the above is not a complete list, but it should
be our most basic API for programs to use. In order to make our
system rich in flexibility, we need a way to extend its capabilities.
Component Interfaces allow this to happen, this way we can extend the
DotGNU system and not break it's basic API functions and existing
supported software. Most components would be built around an Object
Oriented Paradigm, however ways to allow access via standard
Procedural languages, should be available.</P>

Some optional API which we might include would be Multimedia support,
such as OpenGL and Sound (OpenAL, or some other sound API). Other
things such as Image handling routines. Another API we should be able
to support would be the ability to handle Dynamic Data Exchange
between programs and services.</P>

With the mentioned API support this should allow any programmer to
write any type of software he wishes on DotGNU. From Word processors
to fully fledged web services using both the DotGNU platform and
framework.</P>

CORBA, including support for CORBA in DotGNU I think should be
important, it allows people to move services across to our platform
in shorter time. CORBA is already well established, support for it is
every where. Including it as an optional API, I think is wise.</P>

Java RMI. If support for Java is to be included in DotGNU a way to
handle RMI requests should also be considered. Although I don't think
a fully functional RMI implementation is required, a way to handle
RMI should be available either by using CORBA. This should allow Java
Beans to use RMI to communicate to a DotGNU service, although it's
well known that Java also has CORBA support.</P>

Web forms, dynamic content on the web is a good idea. DotGNU should
be able to do this, if not support a method on how to do this by
either providing a way to allow this to happen. This can be done
already with out the need for DotGNU, however we should allow a way
for these ways to access the DotGNU framework and the Platform allow
access to these ways also.</P>
