<h2>
 General Information about the DotGNU Project
</h2>
<p>
 DotGNU is being developed jointly under the auspices
 of <a href="">FreeDevelopers</a>
 and the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>.
 The DotGNU system will be a well-integrated part of the
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU system</a> and it will
 also be made available to the users of all other
 widely-used operation systems.  If you wish to receive
 important announcements about the DotGNU project, please
 subscribe to the <a href="">DotGNU
 announcements mailing list</a>.
</p>
<h2> Mailing Lists </h2>
<p>
 The DotGNU project has the following mailing lists:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  The <a href="">DEVELOPERS</a>
  mailing list for general development discussions. For example, feature
  requests are discussed here.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="">ANNOUNCE</a>
  mailing list for press releases and other important announcements
  concerning the DotGNU system.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="">AUTH</a>
  mailing list for moving forward with quickly creating a first,
  useful incarnation of the <a href="./auth.html">DotGNU Virtual
  Identities</a> system.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="">ARCH</a>
  for moving forward with designing the architecture of the DotGNU
  system and <a href="./arch.html">DotGNU platform</a>.  This list is
  working on long-term stuff.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="">BIZPLAN</a>
  mailing list for everyone who is interested in DotGNU BizPlan.
 </li>
 <li>
  The <a href="">WEBSITE</a>
  mailing list which supports the webmaster of the DotGNU website.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Please avoid cross-posting to multiple of these lists.  If something
 needs a broader audience than just one of the specialized mailing
 lists, post it to DEVELOPERS.
</p>
<p>
 For a quick introduction to some key points that have been discussed,
 please refer to the messages referred in this
 <a href="http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2001-August/000719.html">summary
 post by Antonio Ognio</a>. (Such summary posts are definitely
 worthwhile, and the maintainer of this page is very open to
 adding links to more such summaries.)
</p>
<h2>
 Weekly IRC Meetings
</h2>
<p>
 DotGNU holds weekly meetings to discuss any issues
 of relevance; to allow the developers to catch up
 with each other; and to allow new members to ask
 questions and find out how to join in.
</p>
<p>
 The meetings are conducted via IRC in the channel
 times:
</p>
<pre>
    Saturday 1000 UTC
    Saturday 2200 UTC
</pre>
<p>
 The first is best for DotGNU members east of UTC
 and the second is best for DotGNU members west
 of UTC.  Some of the key DotGNU members attend
 both meetings.
</p>
<p>
 The logs of #dotgnu are always available here:
 <a href="http://ajmitch.linuxworks.co.nz/">http://ajmitch.linuxworks.co.nz/</a>
</p>
<p>
 Note: the times are UTC, not GMT. If you use the GNU 
 operating system (e.g. GNU/Linux, the popular combination 
 of the GNU system with the kernel called Linux) or a Unix 
 system, then the command "date; date -u" will give you
 your current time in both local and UTC, allowing
 you do determine when the next meeting will occur.
</p>
<h2>
 DotGNU technical specifications
