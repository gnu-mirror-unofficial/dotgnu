DotGNU, the GNU project's Free Software alternative to .NET, has come a
long way in the last 2.5 years, and it is now possible to use DotGNU to
implement application programs and web services in C#, running them in
the DGEE webservice server, and integrating them with the phpGroupWare
web-based GroupWare suite.

DotGNU addresses the risk of monopolistic .NET platform vendor lock-in,
since now you can compile and run C# and C applications that use the
base class libraries, XML, and System.Windows.Forms under multiple
operating systems, such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, MS Windows,
and more!

DotGNU currently consists of three main development projects (further
components will be added over time):


    * DotGNU Portable.NET, which contains an implementation of the
      Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) - more commonly referred to
      as &quot;.NET&quot;.  This component contains a very portable runtime engine,
      compilers for C# and C, a C# class library, and related development
      tools.  More languages (particularly Java and VB.NET) are in progress.

    * phpGroupWare, a multi-user web-based GroupWare suite, which also
      serves to provide a good collection of webservice components,
      all of which can be accessed through XML-RPC so that you can
      easily integrate them into webservice applications of your own.

    * The DGEE webservice server provides the functionality of accepting,
      validating and satisfying web service requests.  It is implemented
      on top of a highly scalable distributed middleware called &quot;Goldwater&quot;.


The DotGNU 0.1 CD-ROM is available from commercial vendors such as

(BitTorrent is a Free Software P2P system that allows many users to
download a file, even when the download link is being slashdotted,
without harm to the server which offers the file.  You can download a
BitTorrent client here: <A HREF="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html">http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html</A> )

Since DotGNU is Free Software, it can be freely shared.  If you don't
have a CD burner, ask a friend to burn a copy for you!
