<h1>Acronyms Explained</h1>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="IL">IL</a></dt>
	<dd>Intermediate Language.  This is the bytecode format that is used
		to represent compiled programs.  It has sufficient instructions
		to support many programming languages, including C#.</dd>

<dt><a name="CIL">CIL</a></dt>
	<dd>Common Intermediate Language.  This term is used in the <a href="#ecma">ECMA</a>
		standards.  Prior to ECMA standardization, it was known as IL.
		We use the two acronyms interchangeably.</dd>
<dt><a name="MSIL">MSIL</a></dt>
	<dd>Microsoft Intermediate Language.  This is exactly the same as
		CIL, but some media reports have called it &quot;MSIL&quot; for
		some reason.</dd>
<dt><a name="CTS">CTS</a></dt>
	<dd>Common Type System.  The standard type system that is used
		to represent programming language constructs such as objects
		and types.  A language doesn't have to use the CTS, but doing
		so improves interoperability.</dd>
<dt><a name="CLS">CLS</a></dt>
	<dd>Common Language Specification.  A set of conventions for types
		and libraries that promote interoperability between programming
		languages.</dd>
<dt><a name="CLR">CLR</a></dt>
	<dd>Common Language Runtime.  The engine that executes CIL programs.
		In DotGNU Portable.NET's case, this is the &quot;<code>ilrun</code>&quot;
		program.</dd>
<dt><a name="CLI">CLI</a></dt>
	<dd>Common Language Infrastructure.  The complete system, comprising
		CIL, CTS, CLS, and CLR.</dd>
<dt><a name="CLI">JVM</a></dt>
	<dd>Java Virtual Machine.
	The bytecode system of the Java language.</dd>
<dt><a name="C#">C#</a></dt>
	<dd>Pronounced &quot;C-Sharp&quot;.  The primary programming language that is
		used with the CLI, but by no means the only such language.</dd>
<dt><a name="PE">PE/COFF</a></dt>
	<dd>Portable Executable / Common Object File Format.  This is the
		binary format used by the 32-bit Microsoft Windows system
		to represent compiled applications.  The CLI extends PE/COFF
		with new sections containing CIL definitions.</dd>
<dt><a name="ECMA">ECMA</a></dt>
	<dd>European Computer Manufacturer's Association.  The standards
		body that Microsoft has chosen to standardize CLI.  The
		standards are at <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-334.HTM"><code>http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-334.HTM</code></a> (C#)
and at <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-335.HTM"><code>http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-335.HTM</code></a> (CLI).
If you wish to contribute to the C# library, you will also need the
following file: <a href="ftp://ftp.ecma.ch/ecma-st/Ecma-335-xml.zip"><code>ftp://ftp.ecma.ch/ecma-st/Ecma-335-xml.zip</code></a>.
Unpack this zip file and then use the &quot;<code>csdoc2html</code>&quot; program (which
	you can find in the <code>csdoc</code> directory of the pnet package
	of <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">DotGNU Portable.NET</a>)
	DotGNU to convert the XML file into HTML, so that you can view its
	contents more easily.
ECMA specifies the bare minimum necessary to get a Common Language
Runtime (CLR) to work.  However, this bare minimum is not very useful
for realistic C# applications.
Microsoft's .NET Framework SDK contains a lot more classes in its
base class libraries.  Because we wish to be (more or less) compatible
with Microsoft's .NET offerings, we have to provide more than what ECMA
specifies.</dd>
<dt><a name="gcc">gcc</a></dt>
<dd>The GNU Compiler Collection, which currently contains front ends for C,
	C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for
	these languages.  GCC is good for creating native code
	for register-based CPU's,  but adapting it to generate IL bytecode
	would not be an easy task.  (The right way to do it would be
	to add, besides the &quot;Register Transfer language&quot; which is used
	internally in <code>gcc</code>, in addition a &quot;Stack Transfer
	Language&quot; (STL), that passes all languages through a separate code
	generator that knows about stack machines.  Then we can write STL
	back-ends for <a href="#IL">IL</a> and <a href="#JVM">JVM</a>
	bytecode.  Both gcj (the GNU compiler for Java) and DotGNU would
	benefit	from this.)</dd>
<dt><a name="cscc">cscc</a></dt>
<dd>A compiler collection which can compile C and C# to IL or Java bytecode.
This is part of DotGNU Portable.NET</dd>
<dt><a name="DGEE">DGEE</a></dt>
<dd>The <a href="./dgee.html">DotGNU Execution Environment</a>.</dd>
<dt><a name="SEE">SEE</a></dt>
<dd>DotGNU's <a href="./see.html">Secure Execution Environment</a>.</dd>
<dt><a name="DEE">DEE</a></dt>
<dd>DotGNU's <a href="./see.html">Distributed Execution Environment</a>.</dd>
<dt><a name="VRS">VRS</a></dt>
<dd>DotGNU's <a href="./vrs.html">Virtual Remote Server</a>.</dd>
