<H1>Active DotGNU Project Proposals</H1>
In this section we list DotGNU Project Proposals which are under
active development, and which we expect to become useful pieces of
Free Software regardless of whether they become "officially" part
of DotGNU.
<P>
We believe that this is the best way for realizing a huge Free
Software project like DotGNU:  The coordinating team must give
capable developers every freedom in creating useful contributions.
It is possible that in some areas we may in the end have the luxury of
choosing between two (or possibly even more) good solutions, but even
then those solutions which don't get chosen to be "officially DotGNU"
will be valuable pieces of Free Software that will work well with
DotGNU.  With Free Software, the true freedom of choice will always be
in the hands of software users, and it will not be inappropriately
influenced by the decisions of the DotGNU Steering Committee
concerning what is, and what isn't "officially DotGNU".

<H2>List of Active Project Proposals</H2>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Virtual Remote Server</STRONG><P>
<a href="http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/VRS/index.html">Virtual
Remote Server</a> is a pure p2p server cluster that
provides several of the most important advantages of a
centralized server.  Those are 
<OL><LI>a persistent, easily accessible net presence, and 
<LI>a consistent response to requests.  In other words,
a common and manageable database.
</OL>
<P>
VRS is an alternative to the "SEE/DEE" approach which is more based on
a centralized ASP model (potentially a commercial one) in which the
users have an escape clause, and can remove their data if disgruntled
and provide it from their own local machine.
<P>
VRS takes the opposite approach.  It starts with the
local machine, where the local client/server node
software runs (called the Local Data Server LDS). 
These individual nodes then aggregate, forming the VRS
itself.  I think commercial participation in such a
system is possible by providing scaled up node
resources, a branded port of entry into a VRS cluster
and administrative services.   But that business will
always be at the mercy of their subscribers, not the
subscriber at the mercy of the business.  The
subscriber can always pull their registered components
out of the system.  Ever more so, if enough
subscribers also pull their nodes, the offending
businesses cluster server literally evaporates.  They
HAVE to play nice.
<P>
VRS will be developed at Savannah:

<P>
<LI><STRONG>FrePort</STRONG><P>
The Freport Project wishes to create a plug-in module for the
<A href="../see.html">Secure Execution Environment daemon (SEE)</A>. The
module will implement secure and private, named data storage and
retrieval and will be useful for authorization, authentication, or
general data storage.  The plug-in will perform many of the functions
of remote open LDAP, with similar functionality to proprietary
solutions such as Microsoft's Passport.
<P>
Unlike other products, primary importance is placed on providing data
and metadata security, user privacy and anonymity, and system
adaptability, while not compromising transportability across devices and
point of access. The Freport system is not a unitary system, but instead
possesses it's own plug-in system designed to adapt the technology to a
variety of data storage mechanisms and networking systems.
<P> 
The project is currently in the architectural development stage.
<P>
For more information, please refer to the
<A href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freport-see/">Savannah
project space</A> of this project.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>macs</STRONG><P>
<a href="http://sf.net/projects/macs">macs</a> aims to be a general
purpose authentication, authorization, and user-profiling backend,
frontendable by anything. macsDG will be a DotGNU-specific project to
integrate macs with DotGNU, by creating macs clients, and extending macs
servers, to plug into the <a href="../see.html">Secure Execution
Environment daemon (SEE)</a>. These clients will protect the SEE via the
servers. See the README on the <a href="http://macs.sf.net/">macs page</a>
for an overview. (The SEE could be in the ??? box in the diagram.)
<P>
The plan for the time being is to continue development on a macs
prototype until it is fully featured and functional. At that time, the
macsDG project will begin writing macs clients for the SEE, while the
macs servers are refactored/rewritten. Finally, macsDG will extend the
new (non-prototype) macs servers, adding a compile-time option for making
SEE plugins out of them.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>IDsec</STRONG><P>
IDsec is a mechanism that provides an identity for users on the internet.
This is being developed by <A href="http://www.telin.nl">Telematica
Instituut</A> in Enschede, Netherlands.  A preliminary implementation
that implements the core of the different parts of the system exists,
and it will be released under GPL soon.
<P>
Identity in this system means that a user is known by a certain profile which
contains precisely those attributes that the user wants to reveal to
the requester of his profile.
<P>
Access to profile attributes is managed by the user himself. Certificates and
public/private key mechanisms ensure that information is exchanged in a
secure way between parties that trust each other.
<P>

<P>
<LI><STRONG>DotGNU-Jabber Integration</STRONG><P>
The <A href="http://www.theoretic.com/dotgnu">DotGNU-Jabber
Integration Project</A> aims to help DotGNU catch up to 
Microsoft by using Jabber's existing code and user base. Jabber is a 
well-developed 100% open protocol for distributed communications, 
handling such things as real-time messaging, presence, authentication, 
and RPC requests. It has existing servers, modules, and clients that 
are, or could become, GPL'ed. It is already implimented in hundreds of 
independent servers and thousands of clients in a distributed network 
all over the Internet and internal intranets.
<P>
Project leader Adam Theo is also looking for ways how DotGNU can
contribute back to Jabber, especially when it comes to a general
distributed services model.
<P>
This project will begin with how Jabber can provide authentication and 
virtual identity services for DotGNU, and expand to data synchronization 
and subscription/publishing systems.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Cashbox</STRONG><P>
David Nicol, who set up <A href="http://tipjar.com">tipjar.com</A> in
1996, will GPL a catalog/order customer-account system, called "cashbox."
