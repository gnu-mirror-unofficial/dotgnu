<H1>Active DotGNU Project Proposals</H1>
In this section we list DotGNU Project Proposals which are under
active development, and which we expect to become useful pieces of
Free Software regardless of whether they become "officially" part
of DotGNU.
<P>
We believe that this is the best way for realizing a huge Free
Software project like DotGNU:  The coordinating team must give
capable developers every freedom in creating useful contributions.
It is possible that in some areas we may in the end have the luxury of
choosing between two (or possibly even more) good solutions, but even
then those solutions which don't get chosen to be "officially DotGNU"
will be valuable pieces of Free Software that will work well with
DotGNU.  With Free Software, the true freedom of choice will always be
in the hands of software users, and it will not be inappropriately
influenced by the decisions of the DotGNU Steering Committee
concerning what is, and what isn't "officially DotGNU".

<LI><STRONG>FrePort</STRONG><P>
The Freport Project wishes to create a plug-in module for the
<A href="../see.html">Secure Execution Environment daemon (SEE)</A>. The
module will implement secure and private, named data storage and
retrieval and will be useful for authorization, authentication, or
general data storage.  The plug-in will perform many of the functions
of remote open LDAP, with similar functionality to proprietary
solutions such as Microsoft's Passport.
<P>
Unlike other products, primary importance is placed on providing data
and metadata security, user privacy and anonymity, and system
adaptability, while not compromising transportability across devices and
point of access. The Freport system is not a unitary system, but instead
possesses it's own plug-in system designed to adapt the technology to a
variety of data storage mechanisms and networking systems.
<P> 
The project is currently in the architectural development stage.
