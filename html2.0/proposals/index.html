 DotGNU Software Development Project Proposals Status Page
</h1>
<p>
 &nbsp;
</p>
<h2>
 Welcome!
</h2>
<p>
 The DotGNU Steering Committee is pleased to announce that we've begun
 accepting proposals for software development projects.  The projects
 that get accepted will make up what DotGNU will become in the future.
 Therefore, we've instituted a formal system for proposing software
 development projects.
</p>
<p>
 Making a formal proposal as outlined below is a first step in the
 direction of allowing your project to become an official part of
 DotGNU.  As explained on the <a href="../proposals/active.html">Active Proposals</a>
 page, this will not always happen immediately, and you need not need
 to wait for official approval before you can start your project.
</p>
<h2>
 Proposing and Starting a Software Development Project
</h2>
<ol>
 <li>
  Download a simple proposal <a href="../../proposal-template.txt">form</a>.
 </li>
 <li>
  View a sample proposal: <a href="../../proposal-structure.txt">proposal-structure.txt</a>
 </li>
 <li>
  Subscribe to the <a href="http://www.dotgnu.info/mailman/listinfo/proposals/">proposals</a> mailing list proposals@dotgnu.info
 </li>
 <li>
  Once you've created a first draft, send it off to the list
  marked as &lt;Original&gt;.  This may start some helpful
  discussions, and it is also the first step towards making your
  project &quot;officially DotGNU&quot;.
 </li>
 <li>
  You may also want to discuss the proposal on the
  <a href="http://www.dotgnu.info/mailman/listinfo/developers/">DotGNU
  developers mailing list.</a>
 </li>
 <li>
  When you have decided that you want to go forward, create the
  project at <a href="http://freesoftware.fsf.org/">http://freesoftware.fsf.org/</a>.
  If your project has already been made officially part of DotGNU,
  answer &quot;yes&quot; to the question of whether you want it to be part of
  GNU. Otherwise, answer &quot;no&quot;. (Answering &quot;yes&quot; before your project is
  officially part of DotGNU can result in a long delay before the
  project creation request is approved.)
 </li>
 <li>
  You are very welcome to use the DotGNU
  <a href="http://www.dotgnu.info/mailman/listinfo/developers/">DotGNU developers mailing list</a>
  to report progress with your project, ask for help, and coordinate
  with other projects.  For this, it is not necessary for your project
  to be &quot;officially DotGNU&quot;. The only requirements are that the project
  must be GPL'd Free Software, and that it should not be totally
  irrelevant to DotGNU.
 </li>
</ol>
<h2>
 Guidelines for Proposing a Software Development Project
</h2>
<p>
 Of initial importance is the subject header. There is a subject
 header line in the template. What this points to is the subject
 header line in the e-mail to the proposals mailing list. The
 header should take the following form:
</p>
<p>
 [<em>proposal type</em>-proposal]&lt;<em>stage</em>&gt;<em>proposal-name</em>
</p>
<p>
 An example from the sample proposal:
</p>
<p>
 [Subsystem-Proposal]&lt;Original&gt;DotGNU Project-Proposal Structure.
</p>
<p>
 This may seem long, but it tells us some very important information
 about the proposal. It tells us the type of proposal, what stage the
 proposal is in, and the name of the proposal. The type of proposal
 will generally, at this point, be a Project-Proposal. Later, there
 could be Subsystem-Proposals, Spec-Proposals, etc... The system is
 ultimately flexible. The stage can either be Original, Revised, or
 Final. Original is the very first draft that is sent to the list.
 Once the draft is modified, it is labelled as Revised. Once the
 steering committee has approved the project, the draft is marked
 Final.
</p>
<p>
 Be sure to fill in all fields and be sure to mark the version number
 as an integer. The version number exists strictly to keep track of
 which iteration of a proposal a person is reading. Also, be sure to
 include a log of you proposal revisions in the revisions section on
 the template.
</p>
<h2>
 On Being a GNU Maintainer
</h2>
<p>
 Accepted projects will more than likely become GNU projects. If you
 volunteer to be a maintainer, be sure that you've read and have
 agreed to
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain_toc.html">http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain_toc.html</a>.
 If you do not agree, then do not volunteer to maintain a package yourself.
