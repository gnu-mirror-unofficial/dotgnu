<h1>
 DotGNU Virtual Identities
</h1>
<p>
 With a &quot;Virtual ID&quot; system we mean an integrated solution to the
 following problems:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Authentication
  </strong>
  <p>
   Basically, a <em>Virtual ID</em> consists in some digital information,
   and the user must be able to prove ownership of this Virtual ID.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Authorization
  </strong>
  <p>
   A user who has proved ownership of a Virtual ID may be authorized to
   access certain information, or perform certain actions.  Webservice
   servers must be able to verify this.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Customization
  </strong>
  <p>
   Users should be able to customize their internet experience:  There
   should be a way in which users can communicate their preferences to
   all webservice servers that want to take user preferences into
   consideration.  This must be set up in a way that avoids violating the
   user's privacy.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Selected Sharing of Private Data
  </strong>
  <p>
   There should be a simple way in which a website can request private
   information such as email address, postal address, telephone number,
   fax number, or credit card number from the user.  Such private
   information must never be given to the website without explicit
   approval from the user, but the user should not be required to enter
   the information every time.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 We must NOT create a passport &quot;portal&quot;.  That is technically and
 morally wrong.  We must create a framework that can be scaled and
 deployed at any level desired, whether locally, at an enterprise,
 or at a portal.  Authentication and access to private information
 should be peer to peer to preserve local storage of those things
 which should remain in private users hands.  The ability to migrate
 data upward can be provided for, on a selective basis, and controls
 must be provided as to who may or may not access specific user
 information.
</p>
<p>
 For extremely high reliability (avoiding any single point of
 failure) this framework can be run on top of the DotGNU
 Distributed Execution Environment.  (For more information about this
 please refer to the <a href="./arch.html">DotGNU Platform</a> page.)
</p>
<h2>
 How DotGNU will address these problems
</h2>
<p>
 In the current situation (with Microsoft trying hard to dominate
 the auth services market, and nobody really knowing what exactly
 the users will want) the only reasonable way for DotGNU to go
 forward is to implement several reasonable approaches, and leave
 the final decision to the users.
</p>
<h2>
 Suggested terminology
</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <em>Profile Host</em>: Hosts profiles (&quot;virtual identities&quot;)
  to facilitate remote access.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>Profile Owner</em>: Owns profile data and controls access to
  it.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>Service Provider</em>: Creates and delivers Web Services that
  request profile data.
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>
 How you can contribute
</h2>
<p>
 Please start by having a look at the various
 <a href="./projects.html">official DotGNU projects</a> and
 <a href="./proposals/active.html">active proposals</a>.  We
 encourage you to make your own decision on what you think would
 be the best way to implement Virtual Identities, and discuss these
 matters on the
 <a href="http://www.dotgnu.info/mailman/listinfo/auth/">auth
 mailing list</a>.  Then you should either join a project that
 goes in a good direction, or you are free to start a new,
 competing Virtual ID project if you think that none of the existing
 projects is a winner.

 Provider&quot; terminology has been proposed by

 in a <a href="http://www.dotgnu.info/pipermail/auth/2002-January/000432.html">post
