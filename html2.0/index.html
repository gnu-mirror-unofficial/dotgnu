<h1>
 GNU Freedom for the Internet
</h1>
<p>
 The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">GNU project</a>
 is about making sure that computer users have certain important freedoms.
 If you use GNU/Linux today, you have these freedoms on a single computer.
 Generally speaking, the internet is also a place of freedom, because it
 is built on open protocols which are not in any way patent-encumbered,
 and which are generally implemented in
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>.
 However, this <a href="freedom.html">freedom is threatened</a> now by a
 monopolistic company which wants to catch us all in their dotNET.  Read
 this <a href="http://users.hol.gr/~barbanis/cavafy/walls.html">warning
 written in 1896</a>.
</p>
<p>
 The DotGNU project is the response of the Free Software movement.  We
 want to have technological leadership in the webservices arena while at the
 same time making our system compatible with dotNET so that businesses can
 migrate to DotGNU without much trouble.  The main objective is to have a
 system that truly belongs to the developers, which is not in any way
 controlled by a profit-oriented monopolistic company.
</p>
<p>
 DotGNU could be called an &quot;operating system for the internet&quot; - it's a
 collection of tools that allow software components to
 interact with each other over the internet.  The most impressive parts are
 currently:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">DotGNU Portable.NET</a>, which builds a suite
   of compilers (the currently supported languages are C and C#, with Java
   support in the works), C# class library, and related development tools.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.phpgroupware.org/">phpGroupWare</a>, a multi-user web-based GroupWare
   suite, which also serves to provide a good collection of webservice
   components, all of which can be accessed through XML-RPC so that you can
   easily integrate them into webservice applications of your own.
  </li>
  <li>
   The <a href="./dgee.html">DGEE</a> webservice server is also moving forward
   nicely.
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 Now DotGNU news is also available as an RSS feed. <a href="index.rdf" class="linksbody"><img valign="bottom" border="0" src="g/xml.jpg" /></a>

Besides &quot;mscorlib.dll&quot; being now 100% signature compatible with the

other big news is that the library can now be built in multiple configurations
with &quot;./configure --with-profile=X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is one of the following:

full, ecma, compact, compact-fp, kernel, kernel-fp, tiny, tiny-fp

	<h2>Oct 12-10-2002: Weekend Warriors Programme</h2>
</a>
<p>
	To speed up the compiler development , Peter Minten, Gopal.V and 
	Andrew Mitchell have formed the Weekend Warriors. This is a group
	of part time developers who devote their weekends to hacking pnet.
	This is responsible for the flurry of activity which happens on
	every weekend. The group proposes to take part of the compiler
	development in the following announcement.:

</a>
<p>
	As is customary, DotGNU will be having a Meet-a-thon this quarter
	as well. This is an event to take stock of the last quarter 
	for the DotGNU developers, and an excellent oppurtunity for newcomers
	to familiarize themselves with the project. See the proposal for

	<h2>Oct 02-10-2002: Java Bytecode Output for Portable.Net</h2>
</a>
<p>
	Sylvain Pasche has fixed up the Portable.Net assembler to generate
	the correct java bytecode. Now the C# compiler sports a nice JVM 
	output backend. The results become really interesting when the 
	whole pnetlib can be compiled into JVM code. Read full details
