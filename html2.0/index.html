<h1>
Free Software for Webservices and for C# Programming
</h1>
<p>
The DotGNU project aims to be for webservices and for C# programs
what GNU/Linux is rapidly becoming for desktop and server applications:
the industry leader and provider of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
solutions.
</p>
<p>
 DotGNU currently consists of three main development projects (<a href="join.html">further components will be added over time</a>):
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="./pnet.html">DotGNU Portable.NET</a>, an implementation
   of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), more commonly known
   as &quot;.NET&quot;, includes everything that you need to compile
   and run C# and C applications that use the base class libraries,
   XML, and Systems.Windows.Forms.  Currently supported CPUs:
   x86, ppc, arm, parisc, s390, ia64, alpha, mips, sparc.
   Supported operating systems: GNU/Linux (on PCs, Sparc, iPAQ,
   Sharp Zaurus, PlayStation 2, Xbox,...), *BSD, Cygwin/Mingw32,
   Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX.

 Major motivations for being involved in DotGNU include:
 <ul>
  <li>
    A desire to prevent Microsoft from achieving their stated goal

    that has defined the personal computer industry, is ending&quot;.

    DotGNU works to prevent this disaster</a>.
  </li>
  <li>A technical interest in webservices, bytecode systems, and compiler
   construction.
  </li>
  <li>A business strategy of using DotGNU, and contributing to DotGNU.
    DotGNU is part of
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> and thereby protected from
    coming under the control of any single company.

<h2>March 13-3-2004: DotGNU Portable.NET 0.6.4 released</h2>
</a>
<p>
Portable.NET 0.6.4 and Treecc 0.3.0 have been released.  The big change this
cycle is the C compiler, which has now reached the point of being useful.  We
now need lots of volunteers to help flesh out the C library, pnetC, to include
all of the usual libc features.  There have also been a lot of bug fixes and
performance improvements in System.Windows.Forms, thanks to Neil Cawse.  And
Richard Baumann has completely rewritten the System.Xml parser, fixing many
long-standing issues with the XML library.
</p>
<a name="6-03-2004">
	<h2>March 6-3-2004: C Compiler: Significant Progress and Call For Volunteers</h2>
</a>
<p>
The new C compiler type system has been checked in.  Type layout is
now totally dynamic; the IL binary will automatically adapt itself
to the runtime engine it is running on.  This means that DotGNU is
bringing true &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; functionality to C,
running on top of standard CLR implementations.  Unlike Microsoft's
C compiler, whose output will only run on i386-based Windows
systems, ours will run portable ANSI C code on any platform that
has a CLR, be it 32-bit or 64-bit, little-endian or big.
 </p>
<p>
Simple examples of C programs can be compiled to IL now, and
volunteers are needed to work on the standard C library so that
more programs and libraries can be compiled.  Our eventual goal is
to bring a large body of Free Software libraries and programs to
the CLI environment, vastly increasing the range of functionality
beyond the small number of libraries currently defined for C#.

<a href="http://www.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu/">http://www.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu/</a>)
were in hiatus between mid-November 2003 and January 2004 due to a
security breach at an important server of the Free Software Foundation,
and the resulting need to set up a much more secure system.  The new
system is available now, although it seems to have a bug which
prevents the <code>www.gnu.org</code> version of the DotGNU website from being
updated.  Since the DotGNU project has important news to share, and I don't
have much hope of this project-specific bug being treated with priority (it may
have to do with DotGNU being under <code>/projects</code> on
<code>www.gnu.org</code> and not under <code>/software</code> like almost
everything else), I'm now updating <code>dotgnu.org</code> without waiting for
the savannah webcvs bug to be fixed.

	<h2>May 29-05-2003: Support for IPv6 and IrDa protocols</h2>
</a>
<p>
	Portable.NET now has support for IPv6 (the &quot;next generation&quot; internet
	protocol which fixes a number of problems with the current version,
	in particular the limited number of available IPv4 addresses) and
	the IrDa sockets protocol (so that now you can use DotGNU to build
	networks between infrared capable handhelds and workstations).  With
	Portable.NET, IrDA is supported in all versions where the OS kernel
	supports it, not just handhelds.  (This differs from Microsoft's
	version of .NET where IrDa capability is not available in the
	workstation-level SDK.)

	<h2>May 25-05-2003: Pnetlib status pages now against .NET 1.1 </h2>
</a>
<p>
	The <a href="http://dotgnu.org/pnetlib-status/">pnetlib-status</a> 
	pages have been updated to include comparisons to the .NET 1.1 standard.
	Only 474 classes to go, so please pick a class , any class and lend
	a hand. We're nearly there !.

	<h2>May 17-05-2003: It's raining compilers this weekend</h2>
</a>
<p>
Version 0.0.2 of the
DotGNU JAVA compiler has been released and integrated into pnet cvs.
</p>
<a name="17-05-2003b">
	<h2>May 17-05-2003: Compiler for minimalistic programming language and demo webservice</h2>
</a>
<p>
Following a complaint that DotGNU did not yet have a compiler for a
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/">minimalistic programming
language</a>, such a compiler was quickly created, together with a demo
webservice.  The code is in pnet cvs and can serve as a simple example of
a cscc plugin.
</p>
<a name="16-05-2003">
	<h2>May 16-05-2003: Hello World in Visual Basic.NET</h2>
</a>
<p>
The beginnings of Visual Basic.NET support are now in pnet cvs.  Try
&quot;cscc -o hello hello.vb&quot; and run with &quot;ilrun hello&quot;.
If you would like to help out on the VB project, then there is lots of work 
still to do:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Building the treecc nodes in the parser for the remaining syntax.</li>
<li>VB-specific semantic analysis and codegen routines.</li>
<li>Flesh out the standard library in pnetlib/Basic.</li>
<li>Build test cases for the compiler in cscctest.</li>
<li>Build test cases for the standard library in pnetlib/Basic.</li>
</ol>
<p>
1 and 2 require cscc compiler skills - if you're interested in learning the 
compiler, then this is the time to start.  The Java, VB, C#, and C front ends 
will all need lots of eager beavers over the next few months.
3, 4, and 5 are easier, mainly requiring C# and/or VB programming skills.  
Grep for &quot;TODO&quot; under pnetlib/Basic, check out the documentation for the 
Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace on msdn.microsoft.com, and send in those 
patches!

	<h2>May 05-05-2003: Code unroller for ARM CPUs available</h2>
</a>
<p>
Rhys has written a CVM code unroller for ARM/StrongARM platforms.
An unroller uses some simple JIT techniques to translate commonly-used CVM
instructions into native code.  The result is about a 2-3 times improvement
in performance on ARM, compared with the default direct threaded
configuration.

	<h2>May 03-05-2003: Portable.NET 0.5.6 released</h2>
</a>
<p>
Besides &quot;mscorlib.dll&quot; being now 100% signature compatible with the
corresponding assembly in version 1.1 (see previous news item), the
other big news is that the library can now be built in multiple configurations
with &quot;./configure --with-profile=X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is one of the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
full, ecma, compact, compact-fp, kernel, kernel-fp, tiny, tiny-fp

</a>
<p>
The lowest-level library within pnetlib, &quot;mscorlib.dll&quot;, is 
now signature compatible with the corresponding assembly in version 1.1 of 
the .NET Framework SDK.  Every class, every method, every interop marker 
attribute, and every silly little enumerated constant.  All of it!

<p>
	The Dotgnu Webservice container , otherwise known as the 
	Dotgnu execution environment (DGEE) has reached usable
	levels. Chris Smith has hacked up this server which does
	not run inside Apache , but adopts the strategy other
	AppServers like Tomcat has been using. The C# webservice 
	system is functional and uses Apache and 
	<a href="http://www.nfluid.com">Goldwater</a>
	as the network and execution containers respectively. The 
	system is self documenting and includes introspection into 
	the webservices. It currently supports only XmlRpc and is
	only a pre-release.

	<h2>Nov 21-11-2002: DGEE &amp; Intermodule Messaging.</h2>
</a>
<p>

Chris Smith has brought out a nice specification for the DGEE core module
communication. The good thing about this is that it is not tied down to XML
or any encoding format, but allows arbitary data chunks such as XML, C# 
byte code, HTML form post data etc to be packaged together and sent as a 
single message between the internal components of the VRS/SEE core
