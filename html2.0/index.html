<h1>
Free Software for Webservices and for C# Programming
</h1>
<p>
The DotGNU project aims to be for webservices and for C# programs
what GNU/Linux is rapidly becoming for desktop and server applications:
the industry leader and provider of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
solutions.
</p>
<p>
 DotGNU currently consists of three main development projects (<a href="join.html">further components will be added over time</a>):
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="./pnet.html">DotGNU Portable.NET</a>, an implementation
   of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), more commonly known
   as ".NET", includes everything that you need to compile
   and run C# and C applications that use the base class libraries,
   XML, and Systems.Windows.Forms.  Currently supported CPUs:
   x86, ppc, arm, parisc, s390, ia64, alpha, mips, sparc.
   Supported operating systems: GNU/Linux (on PCs, Sparc, iPAQ,
   Sharp Zaurus, PlayStation 2, Xbox,...), *BSD, Cygwin/Mingw32,
   Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX.

  <li>
   <a href="http://www.phpgroupware.org/">phpGroupWare</a>, a multi-user web-based GroupWare
   suite, which also serves to provide a good collection of webservice
   components, all of which can be accessed through XML-RPC so that you can
   easily integrate them into webservice applications of your own.

 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 Major motivations for being involved in DotGNU include:
 <ul>
  <li>
    A desire to prevent Microsoft from achieving their stated goal
    "that the era of 'open computing,' the free exchange of digital information
    that has defined the personal computer industry, is ending". 
    <a href="danger.html">Read the quotation in context and learn how
    the Free Software movement works to prevent this disaster</a>.  The
    contribution of the DotGNU project might turn out to be important.
  </li>
  <li>A technical interest in webservices, bytecode systems, and compiler
   construction.
  </li>
  <li>A business strategy of using DotGNU, and contributing to DotGNU.
    DotGNU is part of
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> and thereby protected from
    coming under the control of any single company.

<h2>December 03-12-2005: Portable.NET and libjit progress</h2>
</a>
<p>
Work on libjit (A JIT designed to be independent of any particular virtual machine bytecode format or language) has resumed again and we a gearing towards using it in Portable.NET soon.
Recently, there have also been <a href="http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/libjit-developers/2005-November/000007.html">donations</a> which will be distributed amongst developers who contribute code to get libjit finished and hook it into Portable.NET's runtime engine.
</p>
<p>
On Portable.NET related news, there have been many changes since the last release, probably the most notable one is the development of libCrayons, the new System.Drawing backend, which will debut in Portable.NET's next release.
With a bit of luck, developers can even get one of the <a href="http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/pnet-developers/2005-December/002924.html">Windows.Forms related bounties</a> for their code contribution.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in any of the recent libjit or Portable.NET developments you should subscribe to the <a href="./lists.html">mailing lists</a> or talk to us on <a href="./irc.html">IRC</a>.

<h2>December 05-12-2004: Video clip of DotGNU running on Encore Simputer</h2>
</a>
<p>
DotGNU Portable.NET has been ported to the
<a href="http://www.ncoretech.com/simputer/">Encore Simputer</a>,
a handheld computer based on on Intel's StrongARM CPU (a RISC
microprocessor designed for embedded applications), within 72
hours after the release of Encore's port of the GNU/Linux
development tools for this platform at the "Linux Bangalore/2004"
conference.  Conference organiser Atul Chitnis
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:G3JRKZqn5aMJ:www.manoramaonline.com/servlet/ContentServer%3Fpagename%3Dmanorama/MmArticle/CommonFullStory%26c%3DMmArticle%26channel%3DHome%26cid%3D1102102293091">said</a>,
''I threw the challenge as a joke, the bet being a cup of coffee. Gopal
borrowed a PC at the conference, and finally an Encore Simputer, and came to me

<h2>May 13-5-2004: libjit-0.0.2 has been released!</h2>
</a>
<p>
Rhys has packaged up the current state of the libjit tree into a
<a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/download/libjit-0.0.2.tar.gz">libjit
0.0.2</a> release.
</p>
<p>
Libjit is now at the state where primary testing and bug fixing can begin.  We 
initially need test cases that cover all of the functions in "jit-insn.h".
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to write a test case is to write a small program in the 
"Dynamic Pascal" language that exercises the feature in question.  Then place 
it into the "libjit/tests" directory.  The "libjit/tests/README" file 
contains more information on how to do this.  A couple of test cases are 
already provided that demonstrate the concept.
</p>
<a name="27-04-2004">
<h2>April 27-4-2004: libjit-0.0.0f has been released!</h2>
</a>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/libjit.html">libjit</a>
library implements Just-In-Time compilation functionality. Unlike 
other JIT's, this one is designed to be independent of any particular virtual 
machine bytecode format or language. The hope is that Free Software projects 
can get a leg-up on proprietary VM vendors by using this library rather than 
spending large amounts of time writing their own JIT from scratch.
</p>
<p>
This JIT is also designed to be portable to multiple architectures. If you run 
libjit on a machine for which a native code generator is not yet available, 
then libjit will fall back to interpreting the code. This way, you don't need 
to write your own interpreter for your bytecode format if you don't want to.
</p>
<p>
libjit is independent of pnet (that's one of the main points!) but we'll
eventually modify pnet to use it for JIT'ing.
</p>
<p>
In the newly released version 0.0.0f, tutorials 1 to 4 now work correctly
using the interpreted back end, which should allow people to experiment with
real examples now. The x86 and ARM back-ends should follow in the next few
days.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/libjit-developers">mailing list
for libjit-specific discussions</a> has been set up.

<h2>March 13-3-2004: DotGNU Portable.NET 0.6.4 released</h2>
</a>
<p>
Portable.NET 0.6.4 and Treecc 0.3.0 have been released.  The big change this
cycle is the C compiler, which has now reached the point of being useful.  We
now need lots of volunteers to help flesh out the C library, pnetC, to include
all of the usual libc features.  There have also been a lot of bug fixes and
performance improvements in System.Windows.Forms, thanks to Neil Cawse.  And
Richard Baumann has completely rewritten the System.Xml parser, fixing many
long-standing issues with the XML library.
</p>
<a name="6-03-2004">
	<h2>March 6-3-2004: C Compiler: Significant Progress and Call For Volunteers</h2>
</a>
<p>
The new C compiler type system has been checked in.  Type layout is
now totally dynamic; the IL binary will automatically adapt itself
to the runtime engine it is running on.  This means that DotGNU is
bringing true "write once, run anywhere" functionality to C,
running on top of standard CLR implementations.  Unlike Microsoft's
C compiler, whose output will only run on i386-based Windows
systems, ours will run portable ANSI C code on any platform that
has a CLR, be it 32-bit or 64-bit, little-endian or big.
 </p>
<p>
Simple examples of C programs can be compiled to IL now, and
volunteers are needed to work on the standard C library so that
more programs and libraries can be compiled.  Our eventual goal is
to bring a large body of Free Software libraries and programs to
the CLI environment, vastly increasing the range of functionality
beyond the small number of libraries currently defined for C#.

security breach at an important server of the Free Software Foundation,
and the resulting need to set up a much more secure system.  The new
system is available now, although it seems to have a bug which
prevents the <code>www.gnu.org</code> version of the DotGNU website from being
updated.  Since the DotGNU project has important news to share, and I don't
have much hope of this project-specific bug being treated with priority (it may
have to do with DotGNU being under <code>/projects</code> on
<code>www.gnu.org</code> and not under <code>/software</code> like almost
everything else), I'm now updating <code>dotgnu.org</code> without waiting for
the savannah webcvs bug to be fixed.

screenshot</a> shows both "gedit" (a GNOME app) and "kcalc" (a KDE app) running
as two children of the same Xsharp main window.  This is important because the
next version of WinForms will have a HTML web browser control widget, and
we will want to embed an existing third-part Free Software web browser, and
not write a web browser from scratch in C#.
