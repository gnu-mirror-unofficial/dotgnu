<h1>
 .NET Functionality And More
</h1>
<p>
The mission of the DotGNU project is to provide:
<ul>
<li> A language independent platform supporting many popular programming
languages including C, C#, Java, Perl, Python, PHP.</li>
<li> Compatability with .NET</li>
<li> An operating-system independent platform (akin to Java)</li>
<li> Support for webservices in a manner that avoids the issues of
     Free Software ethics that would otherwise arise with Application
     Service Providers.</li>
<li> A decentralized network paradigm.</li>
<li> <em>A system that truly belongs to the developers</em>, not to
     some profit-oriented monopolistic company.  We want compatibility
     with .NET for practical reasons, but otherwise the contributing
     developers determine what the system will be like.  This is <em>our</em>
     system.</li>
</ul>
</p>
For more information will be added here soon.  For now, please refer to the
<a href="http://wiki.dotgnu.org/">DotGNU Wiki</a>
<h2>
What exactly is .NET?
</h2>
<p>
For Microsoft Inc., .NET really is not primarily about technology,
rather it is a marketing strategy that is directed against the Java
system of Sun Microsystems, and also against the GNU/Linux system.
