<h2>
 Weekly IRC Meetings
</h2>
<p>
 DotGNU holds weekly meetings to discuss any issues
 of relevance; to allow the developers to catch up
 with each other; and to allow new members to ask
 questions and find out how to join in.
</p>
<p>
 The meetings are conducted via IRC in the channel
 times:
</p>
<pre>
    Saturday 1000 UTC
    Saturday 2200 UTC
</pre>
<p>
 Note: the times are UTC, not GMT. If you use the GNU 
 operating system (e.g. GNU/Linux, the popular combination 
 of the GNU system with the kernel called Linux) or a Unix 
 system, then the command &quot;date; date -u&quot; will give you
 your current time in both local and UTC, allowing
 you do determine when the next meeting will occur.
</p>
<h2>
<code>#dotgnu</code> Channel Rules
</h2>
<ol>
<li>Treat everyone with kindness, even if you don't like what they say.</li>
<li>When there is an active on-topic conversation (i.e. something that
concerns the DotGNU project, or some of its development projects),
you are welcome to contribute in a constructive manner, but please don't
otherwise interrupt the conversation.</li>
<li>If necessary, the above rules will be enforced by means of channel
moderation.</li>
<li>When there is no active on-topic conversation, off-topic chatter is
welcome.  (Building good relationships between DotGNU people is beneficial
to the project).  Such off-topic chatter may be interrupted by serious
DotGNU-related discussion at any time.</li>
</ol>
