<h1>
 DotGNU - Webservices As A Weapon For Software Freedom
</h1>
<p class="maincontent">
  While the DotGNU project was originally started in reaction to
  <a href="danger.html">the threat of Microsoft's .NET strategy</a>, 
  nowadays, the emphasis in our thinking is more on the offensive.
  DotGNU should be seen in the context of the overall desire of
  the free software movement to provide businesses with viable
  alternatives to proprietary software for all business processes.
  One major challenge in this area is to provide a migration path
  which provides significant benefits already during the first
  stages of the transition to free software.  DotGNU helps here,
  because the webservices approach allows to make the transition
  in multiple small steps.

  who said &quot;It is the common fate of the indolent to see their
  rights become a prey to the active. The condition upon which God hath
  given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he
  break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the
  punishment of his guilt.&quot; - <em>John Philpot Curran: Speech upon the
  Right of Election, 1790. (Speeches. Dublin, 1808.)</em>
