<h1>
 DotGNU - Keeping You from Getting Tangled in a Net!
</h1>
<p>
 The DotGNU project was originally started in reaction to Microsoft's
 .NET strategy, for which it will be a complete replacement (and not
 just a Free Software implementation). The parts of .NET strategy about
 which we are most concerned are Microsoft's attempts to gain control of
 the internet and its users. Parts of this strategy, including the plan
 to unleash a <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a//p2p/2001/05/30/hailstorm.html">&quot;Hailstorm&quot;</a> have
 been dropped, <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/04/11/023259.shtml?tid=109">because all the major companies which sell services to consumers have realised that this &quot;Hailstorm&quot; would not be good for them.</a>
 On other fronts, Microsoft is still working hard to entangle everyone
 in their .NET -- In contrast, the goal of DotGNU is to give computer
 users full freedom to use the internet as they want.  For example, the
 DotGNU approach to <a href="./web-services.html">&quot;web services&quot;</a> will
 make it possible for end users to run webservice software on their own
 PC, so that the users are not forced to migrate their data to the
 webservice servers.
</p>
<p>
 DotGNU will use a decentralized paradigm:  No single company, server or
 entity will control authorization.  This avoids privacy problems like
 those recently pointed out in
 <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/consumer/microsoft/stateagletter.html">a letter from the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) on Microsoft's Passport system.</a>
</p>
<p>
 Furthermore, DotGNU will emphasize security, it will use encryption
 wherever possible to keep user data secure and hidden. (According to
 the article
 <a href="http://avirubin.com/passport.html">Risks of the Passport Single Signon Protocol</a>[1],
 Microsoft's approach has some fundamental problems in the area of
 security.  In fact it appears that
 <a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2814881,00.html">Microsoft is storing the password and username for Passport as clear text</a>,
 a huge security risk.)  Because of entirely unrelated, serious
 security problems,
 <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,48105,00.html">Microsoft was forced on Nov 2, 2001 to disable the &quot;virtual wallet&quot; function of the Passport service</a> as
 Marc Slemko
 <a href="http://alive.znep.com/~marcs/passport/">published a sample exploit that demonstrates a cross-site scripting vulnerability.</a>
</p>
<p>
 There are no real remaining traditional competitors to MS, and the US
 government recently failed to contain MS, so the field is left to us. MS has
 announced that it has &quot;bet the company&quot; on .Net, because &quot;Webservices&quot;
 represents the future, and Windows and MS Office will become progressively
 less important. So DotGNU stands between where MS is and where it wants to
 be. Therefore DotGNU and .Net represents the ultimate showdown between
 proprietary and Free Software.

<h2>
 Don't read unpublished Microsoft information
</h2>
<p>
 In order to avoid falling into any legal traps, please be extremely
 careful to avoid reading any unpublished information from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
 We ask every contributor to disclose exactly how much exposure they've
 had to Microsoft stuff, and make them commit to report any additional
 exposure immediately.  Whenever there is even the slightest shade of a
 possible problem,  the contributor needs to refrain from contributing
 until our legal team has been established and it has provided
 appropriate advice.
</p>
<h3>
 Where will DotGNU compete with the Microsoft .Net
 and Hailstorm products?
</h3>
<p>
 In all areas.
</p>
<p>
 Just like it's the goal of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>
 to create a complete operating system that makes it completely
 unnecessary to use a non-free operating system like e.g. Microsoft
 Windows, it's the goal of the DotGNU project to be a complete
 competitor to Microsoft's &quot;.Net initiative&quot; and &quot;Hailstorm&quot; products.
</p>
<p>
 The DotGNU project will compete with Microsoft for end-users,
 business customers and developers.
</p>
<p>
 Microsoft Windows had a huge head start over GNU/Linux in terms
 of user-friendliness to end users.  In spite of Microsoft's vast
 resources, GNU/Linux is already better than Microsoft Windows in
 some areas, and catching up fast in most others.
</p>
<p>
 We believe that the same kind of success story is possible with
 the DotGNU project.  The main difference is that this time,
 Microsoft doesn't have such a big head start.
</p>
<h3>
 What will DotGNU do that those products also want to do?
</h3>
<p>
 The DotGNU system will deliver the same and better benefits to end
 users and business customers, but we will be very careful that no
 company or other organization can gain any monopoly-like power over
 the system.
</p>
<h3>
 How will DotGNU be different from those Microsoft products?
</h3>
<p>
 The DotGNU project will use good ideas from Microsoft as a
 source of inspiration, and Microsoft will probably also use
 good ideas from the DotGNU project as a source of inspiration.
</p>
<p>
 The big difference is that there is a single company (Microsoft)
 in the center of the universe of the &quot;.Net initiative&quot; and
 &quot;Hailstorm&quot; products,  while the DotGNU project creates a
 framework where anyone who wants can offer every service.
 For example, with DotGNU every Internet Service Provider (ISP)
 can offer the equivalent of Microsoft's &quot;Passport&quot; service,
 and the ISP can customize and modify this service according to
 their customers' needs.
</p>
<p>
 In the DotGNU system, the paradigm of decentralization goes so far
 that whenever an Application Service Provider (ASP) makes a program
 available to a customer, the customer is not forced to use the program
 only on the Application Service Provider's computers.  The customers
 can download the program and use it locally on their own PCs.  This is
 in strong contrast to the Microsoft's vision for
 <a href="./web-services.html">&quot;web services&quot;</a>.
</p>
<h3>
 What do you guys think about Hailstorm and Passport?
</h3>
<p>
 Hailstorms tend to be destructive.  And one should not need to use a
 passport in one's own country.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<h3>
 What do you guys think of Microsoft's .Net and Hailstorm efforts?
</h3>
<p>
 Dangerous stuff.  It is often said that the price of freedom is
 eternal vigilance.<sup>3</sup> Unless we counter them, Microsoft's efforts
 are not only a threat to Free Software, they are also extremely
 dangerous tools in the hands of any Evil Government that wants
 to make their citizens unfree.
