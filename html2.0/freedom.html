 DotGNU - Webservices As A Weapon For Software Freedom
</h1>
<p class="maincontent">
  While the DotGNU project was originally started in reaction to
  <a href="danger.html">the threat of Microsoft's .NET strategy</a>, 
  nowadays, the emphasis in our thinking is more on the offensive.
  DotGNU should be seen in the context of the overall desire of
  the free software movement to provide businesses with viable
  alternatives to proprietary software for all business processes.
  One major challenge in this area is to provide a migration path
  which provides significant benefits already during the first
  stages of the transition to free software.  DotGNU helps here,
  because the webservices approach allows to make the transition
  in multiple small steps.
</p>
<h2>Webservices may help solve the problem of software patents</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
When a business process cannot be efficiently carried out using Free Software
because of patent issues, it'll make good business sense to outsource
it <em>as a webservice</em> to a country which doesn't recognize software
patents.  This will make it economically disadvantageous for countries
to recognize software patents, and in a globalized economy
where the various countries are competing with each other,
eventually all countries will want to abolish the patentability
of algorithms and other software inventions.
