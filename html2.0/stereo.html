<h1>
 Stereo of JVM and CLR
</h1>
<p>
From a marketing strategy perspective, Microsoft's primary goal with the .NET
platform is to &quot;kill&quot; Java.  If this should succeed it would be a significant
boost to their monopolistic ambitions; the DotGNU project definately has no
desire to promote C# over Java.  We made the decision early on that we would
like to equally support both Java and C#, and both bytecode systems (JVM and
CLR).  
</p>
<p>
A significant amount of work has been done in this direction. Our compiler
suite is not only able to emit bytecode for the Microsoft-designed CLR, but it
can also be used to generate bytecode for the JVM. We also have a Java-compiler
front-end. Unfortunately, both of these areas of coding work are current
dormant for lack of volunteers.
</p>
<p>
These Java efforts will probably remain dormant until someone steps forward
and volunteers to champion them.
