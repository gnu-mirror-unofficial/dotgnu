<h1>
 Stereo of C and C#
</h1>
<p>
DotGNU's primary system programming languages are C <em>and</em> C#.
A <em>lot</em> of excellent Free Software libraries have been implemented
in C.  These can all be used from C# programs, as well as programs in
other programming languages which can be compiled to IL (the bytecode
system of .NET) as soon as we have ported enough of glibc to work with
the C compiler front-end for cscc (DotGNU's compiler suite).
</p>
<p>
This porting work is done in the pnetC subproject of DotGNU Portable.NET
and it urgently needs more volunteers.
</p>
<h1>
 Stereo of JVM and CLR
</h1>
<p>
From a marketing strategy perspective, Microsoft's primary goal with the .NET
platform is to &quot;kill&quot; Java.  If this should succeed it would be a significant
boost to their monopolistic ambitions; the DotGNU project definately has no
desire to promote C# over Java.  We made the decision early on that we would
like to equally support both Java and C#, and both bytecode systems (JVM and
CLR).  
</p>
<p>
A significant amount of work has been done in this direction. Our compiler
suite is not only able to emit bytecode for the Microsoft-designed CLR, but it
can also be used to generate bytecode for the JVM. We also have a Java-compiler
front-end. Unfortunately, both of these areas of coding work are current
dormant for lack of volunteers.
</p>
<p>
These Java efforts will probably remain dormant until someone steps forward
and volunteers to champion them.
