DGEE - DotGNU Execution Environment
</h1>
<p class="maincontent">
You need this if you want to use webservices with DotGNU and Portable.Net.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
The DotGNU Execution Environment provides the core webservice component of DotGNU and provides the functionality of accepting, validating and satisfying web service requests.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
The DGEE integrates the components on the web service execution path, including network servers, protocols, virtual machines and security mechanisms into a unified application.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
In its basic form the DGEE allows the installation and removal of web services within the repository, accepts XML-RPC requests for these web services and generates browsable documentation for these web services in HTML and XML form.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
The DGEE is inherited and extended by projects such as the
<a href="./see.html">SEE</a> and <a href="./vrs.html">VRS</a>. These
too are execution environments and share the DGEE architecture at heart,
however they introduce additional features such as the concept of distributed
execution, distributed storage and distinct ownership of web services.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
The current version of DGEE can be downloaded via the
<a href="./downloads.html">DotGNU downloads page</a>.
