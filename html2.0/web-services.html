<h1>
 What about &quot;Web Services&quot;?
</h1>
<p>
 Microsoft's concept of &quot;Web Services&quot; is fundamentally flawed because
 it requires end-users to transfer their data to the computer systems
 of Application Service Providers (ASPs).
</p>
<p>
 There is nothing wrong with using an Application Service Provider if
 you want to, but it is ethically wrong to force computer users to use
 ASPs by not giving them the option of running the applications they
 want on their own PCs.
</p>
<p>
 The DotGNU platform solves this problem by allowing the same program
 to be run as an application on the end-user's PC or as a &quot;web service&quot;
 on computer systems that are provided and maintained by an Application
 Service Provider.
</p>
<h2>
 Why DotGNU is better
</h2>
<p>
 There are both ethical and practical reasons why web-based
 applications should be implemented on the
 <a href="./arch.html">DotGNU platform</a> and not as
 pure &quot;web services&quot; like Microsoft wants.
</p>
<h3>
 Ethical reasons
</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
  End-users must be given the freedom to keep their data
  on their own PCs unless they really want to trust an ASP with
  their data.
 </li>
 <li>
  End-users must be given the freedom to choose any software they
  want for processing their data.  With the .NET initiative,
  Microsoft tries to gain monopoly power that would allow them to
  effectively prevent ASPs from making software available that is
  &quot;not compatible&quot; with Microsoft's licensing terms.  Microsoft's
  efforts in this area seem to be directed in particular against
  Free Software that is licensed under the GNU General Public
  License.
 </li>
</ul>
<h3>
 Practical reasons
</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
  In many situations it is only necessary to access some data from
  a single PC.  In these situations it is obviously better when
  the data and the software which processes it are also located on
  this PC.
 </li>
 <li>
  The DotGNU platform makes it easy for ASPs to set up their
  services in such a way that there is no single point of
  failure.  This is in sharp contrast to Microsoft's concept of
  &quot;web services&quot; where all &quot;web services&quot; rely on Microsoft's
  passport system.  If Microsoft's passport system is temporarily
  not available, then all &quot;web services&quot; which rely on it are also
  not available.
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>
 Examples of application programs
</h2>
<p>
 Here are some examples of application programs which should (both for
 ethical and for practical reasons) be implemented on the
 <a href="./arch.html">DotGNU platform</a>
 and not as pure &quot;web services&quot; like Microsoft wants.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Online identity management.
 </li>
 <li>
  Names, nickname, birthdays, anniversaries, pictures, video clips etc.
 </li>
 <li>
  Address book.
 </li>
 <li>
  Rendez-vous facilities, net meetings, conferencing, gatherings etc.
 </li>
 <li>
  Notifications, alerts management and intelligent routing.
 </li>
 <li>
  Inbox items, interacting seamlessly with existing mail systems,
  voice mail and SMS engines.
 </li>
 <li>
  Project, time and task management.
 </li>
 <li>
  Document storage and virtual &quot;hard drives&quot;.
 </li>
 <li>
  Intelligent mirroring of application settings, configuration data.
 </li>
 <li>
  Bookmarks and other Web configuration and identification data.
 </li>
 <li>
  Digital wallet and other transaction records.
 </li>
 <li>
  Device configuration and discovery capabilities.
 </li>
 <li>
  And, of course, reporting, logging, configuration etc. of the
  above services.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 With DotGNU, these applications do not necessarily need to run as &quot;web
 services&quot;.  With the <a href="./arch.html">DotGNU platform</a>, the end
 user will have the choice of running the same application locally in
 an DotGNU Secure Execution Environment on the end user's PC, or over
 the internet in an DotGNU Distributed Execution Environment that may
 be provided by an Application Service Provider.
</p>
<p>
 One DotGNU software development project is to provide an application for
 <a href="./auth.html">online identity management</a>.  This application
 can serve as an example for implementors of other applications for the
 DotGNU platform.
