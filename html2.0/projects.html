<h1>
 DotGNU Meta-Project Structure
</h1>
<p>
 The <a href="./">DotGNU vision</a> is so big that for
 practical reasons DotGNU must be organized as a &quot;meta-project&quot;
 that serves as an umbrella for several software development
 projects, with each of these development projects having a
 a <em>maintainer</em> who is in charge of making sure that they
 keep going in a good direction.
</p>
<p>
This page lists all development projects which have been officially
accepted as DotGNU components, and which are actively being worked
on.  There is a separate page with <a href="join.html">ideas for components
which may possibly be added at a later stage</a>.
</p>
<h1>
 Active DotGNU Development Projects
</h1>
<h2>
 DotGNU Portable.NET
</h2>
<p>
 For strategic reasons, the DotGNU Platform must make it reasonably
 easy to migrate code from Microsoft's .NET to DotGNU, and to write
 programs in a portable manner so that they run on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
 This need is met by the <a href="pnet.html">DotGNU Portable.NET</a>
 project led by Rhys Weatherley.
</p>
<h2>
 DotGNU Execution Environment (DGEE)
</h2>
<p>
 Portable Executables that come in one of the multiple bytecode
 formats supported by the DotGNU platform will be executed in a
 <a href="./dgee.html">DotGNU Execution Environment (DGEE).</a>
 DGEE will also support combining the resources of multiple
 physical machines, for increased reliability and for being
 able to handle heavy loads.
</p>
<h2>
 phpGroupWare
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="http://phpgroupware.org/">phpGroupWare</a> is a multi-user web-based
 GroupWare suite, which also serves to provide a good collection of webservice
 components, all of which can be accessed through XML-RPC so that you can
 easily integrate them into webservice applications of your own.
</p>
<h2>
 Abdabi
</h2>
<p>
 Abdabi is a peer-to-peer system for service announcements
 and service discovery, currently in the design and planning phase.
