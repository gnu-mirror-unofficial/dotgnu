<h1>
 Overall Architecture Of The DotGNU Webservices Platform
</h1>
<h2>DGEE</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
DGEE, the DotGNU Execution Environment provides the core webservice component
of DotGNU and provides the functionality of accepting, validating and
satisfying web service requests.
</p>
<h2>VMs</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
DGEE will be capable of executing multiple different bytecode formats
in appropriate Virtual Machine implementations (VMs).  The dotgnu-pnet
is building (among many other things, which include compilers and system
libraries) a VM implementation for <a href="./acronyms.html#IL">IL</a>.
For Java bytecode, we will use one of the existing available Free
<a href="./acronyms.html#JVM">JVM</a> implementations, possibly SableVM.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
Support for other popular Free Software bytecode systems is also considered
desirable, such as in particular Python bytecode and 
<a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>, the bytecode
system of Perl6.  (In fact Parrot aims to become the bytecode
language of choice for a whole range of dynamic languages.)
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
In addition, DotGNU would like to be the platform of choice for computer
science research projects on innovative new bytecode systems.  (Some early
discussion of such ideas has occurred on the
<a href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/arch">arch mailing list</a> 
but this has not led to concrete development efforts yet.
</p>
<h2>Webservice protocols</h2>
<p class="maincontent">
All components of DotGNU will support the standard webservice protocols for
synchronous webservice interactions such as XML-RPC and SOAP, and in addition
asynchronous webservice interactions via Jabber will be supported.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
DotGNU's native authentication and authorization subsystem will probably
be founded on a FOAF-based virtual identities system.  In addition,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/macs">MACS, the Modular Access Control
System</a> will be available for integrating DotGNU with other auth systems, as
well as making DotGNU's authentication and authorization subsystem available
to non-DotGNU-based applications.
</p>
<h1>Webservice applications</h1>
<p class="maincontent">
In addition to the components of a Webservice platform, and development tools,
there are also a few (currently two) development projects for webservice
applications which are part of DotGNU: phpGroupWare and Forum.
</p>
<p class="maincontent">
DotGNU webservice applications export their functionality via webservice
protocols such as XML-RPC , while they can at the same time also be used
as browser-based &quot;web applications&quot;.  When the needed infrastructure (SEE)
is available, downloadable user interfaces will be added as a third option
for accessing the webservice applications.
