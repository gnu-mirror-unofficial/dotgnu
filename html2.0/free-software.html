 DotGNU's licensing policy
</h1>
<p>
GNU-style &quot;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">copyleft</a>&quot;
licensing is an important defense against the threat of software patents.
</p>
<p>
DotGNU applications and examples are generally available under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html#SEC1">GNU General Public License</a> (GNU GPL).
</p>
<p>

DotGNU libraries are generally available under either the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html#SEC1">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>
(GNU LGPL) or the GPL plus the following linking exception:</p>
<p>

<blockquote>
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.
If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your
version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do
not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
</blockquote></p>
<p>

DotGNU documentation is generally available under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html#SEC1">GNU Free Documentation
License</a> (GNU FDL), with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts,
and no Back-Cover Texts.</p>
<p>

See the individual component packages for further information on
licensing conditions.</p>
<p>

It is a policy of the DotGNU project that we only distribute software that
has a license compatible with the GNU GPL.</p>

<h2>Copying and Selling DotGNU CDs</h2><p>
In particular, you have every right to make and sell copies of the
DotGNU CD.
If you choose to sell DotGNU CD-ROMs, we'll appreciate if you
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/help/donate.html">donate</a> a portion of
the revenue (perhaps 10% ?) for further DotGNU development.  (You are
not under any legal obligation to make such a donation; depending on
your views of ethics you may or may not feel a moral obligation to
donate back to the project.)
</p>
<p>
High-resolution cover-art images, suitable for digital printing, are included
on the CD-ROM at
