<H1>DotGNU Posters for Free Software Advocacy</H1>
<P>
The goal of the DotGNU Posters Project is to create a cool poster
which will promote the Free Software movement in general and at
the same time also raise awareness of the DotGNU project.  We
would like DotGNU to be seen in the context of the overall desire
of the Free Software movement to provide businesses with viable
alternatives to proprietary software for all business processes.
One major challenge in this area is to provide a migration path
which provides significant benefits already during the first
stages of the transition to Free Software.  DotGNU helps here,
because the webservices approach allows to make the transition
in multiple small steps.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to get a dozen of these posters put up in every computer
science department, of universities and technical colleges worldwide.
This requires some funding for printing of the posters and postage,
and while working on securing the needed financial resources we may
also succeed in obtaining some prizes so that we can hold a DotGNU
posters competion.
</P>
<H2>How to contribute</H2>
<P>
Please use GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program for creating
graphics files for this project, and put them under the GNU Free
Documentation License.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous ftp area has been set up on dotgnu.org where you can
upload poster ideas, drafts, submissions, etc. to the <STRONG>incoming</STRONG>
directory.  After uploading something, please let us know by sending
email to posters@dotgnu.org
</P>
<H2>Maybe a New Face for DotGNU?</H2>
<P>
With the upcoming 0.5.0 release of pnet, and a new year 
beginning, it may also be a good time to redress DotGNU in general.
So besides contributions towards the DotGNU Poster, we are also
interested in new slogan and logo ideas.
</P>
<H3>Slogan</H3>
<P>
While our current slogan of <EM>Making The Web Work For You</EM> is
quite ok, we would like to see what other people can come up with. So if
you have some witty verbiage you'd like to spew out, let us know, and
you may get to see your words plastered all over the world.
</P>
<H3>Logo</H3>
<P>
Same story with the logo. We think the one we have rocks, but I am also 
excited to see what other people can come up with. So please, if you're
talented in this sort of thing, help us out.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Distribution and Fund Raising Organizer</H2>
<P>
We need someone to organize distribution and the funds for poster printing.
If you have experience in this area and would like us to be forever 
indebted to you, please contact us.
</P>
<H2>Further Plans and Ideas</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It should be possible to find at every campus at least volunteer
who cares enough about Free Software to help us out by making sure
that the posters are put up in good places.</LI>
<LI>However, producing the posters will require funding.  We need a
significant number of posters to reach all computer science
departments (how many are there, worldwide, anyway?).  Postage will
be a significant expense too.</LI>
<LI>How do we get funding for this?  Maybe it is best to approach
companies which are <EM>not</EM> in the software business concerning
this. </LI>
<LI>Since this project needs funding anyway, we can try to get some
additional funding so that we can hold a competition and have some
nice prizes for those who contributed significantly to what is in the
end chosen as DotGNU poster.</LI>

The coordinating committee for this project currently
consists of Ian Fung (irc nick: alias) and Norbert Bollow
(irc nick: nb).  Both can often be found on the irc channel
#dotgnu at irc.freenode.net and they can also be reached via the
email address posters@dotgnu.org. Details about contest
dates and submissions will be posted later.
