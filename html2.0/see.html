<h1>
 Secure Execution Environment daemon
</h1>
<p>
 SEE will be a deamon implementing a secure execution environent.  This
 project is <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu-see/">under
 development at Savannah</a>.
</p>
<p>
 SEE will support plugins that can be implemented in any language that
 is supported by gcc.
</p>
<p>
 In addition, there will be a plugin that can execute Java bytecode,
 as well as "Portable Executables" containing Microsoft's IL
 ("Intermediate Language") which is also a kind of bytecode.
 That will allow SEE to receive programs in these bytecode formats via
 the internet and executem them in a secure manner.
</p>
<p>
 Other bytecode formats, such as Python bytecode, or the bytecode of
 Perl6, could be supported by similar plugins.
