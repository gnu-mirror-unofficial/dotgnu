	<h1> DotGNU Meet-a-thon - III </h1>
	<p class="mainbody">
	The DotGNU meet-a-thon III is being organized by the DotGNU
	developer community to meet and interact with the rest of the world.
	The DotGNU project has come into it's second year and is still 
	growing stronger still. The project has had a reasonably prosperous
	2002, and has started taking solid shape. 
	</p>
	<p class="mainbody">
	We've built a yet another Quarter million lines in the past year
	and the entire project counts to more than half-a-million lines of code 
	as of now. 
	</p>
	<p class="mainbody">
	Now, the time's come to take stock of what we did and what we missed.
	We would like to know what you think about the project and the code it
	has spewed into the ether.
	</p>
	<p class="mainbody">
	So a 36 hour IRC meet-a-thon is being conducted on irc.freenode.net
	on #dotgnu . The meet is organized as sessions of 4 hours with most major
	developers logging on according to their timezones. The meeting will be
	kicked off at 1000 UTC Saturday. It will continue for the next 36 hours 
	and key dotgnu people will remain on the channel to discuss new ideas,
	meet new people and talk about their projects.
