<H1>The DotGNU Platform</H1>
The DotGNU Platform will consist of the following components:
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Core Platform</STRONG>
    <P>
    This project is responsible for creating the DotGNU bytecode
    specification, DotGNU bytecode interpreter, DotGNU
    bytecode->machine code compiler (may be based on gcc), and a
    compiler from a subset of one popular programming language
    (perhaps Java?) to DotGNU bytecode.
    <P>
    This is a high-priority project.  Support for generating DotGNU
    bytecode will be added to the Free Software implementations of
    compilers by many programming languages by other subprojects of
    the DotGNU project.  This "DotGNU Core Platform" project will
    create a well-documented specification for "DotGNU bytecode" so that
    all everyone who develops or maintains a compiler can add support
    for generating DotGNU bytecode.
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Secure Execution Environment</STRONG>
    <P>
    This project is responsible for creating a Secure Execution
    Environment which can download DotGNU bytecode (or other stuff for
    which an emulation is available - that should include .NET stuff)
    from the network and execute it in a secure manner.
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Distributed Execution Environment</STRONG>
    <P>
    DotGNU's Distributed Execution Environment will be like an
    operating system for a "distributed computer" consisting of
    several instances of the "DotGNU Secure Execution Environment"
    that are running on several computers.  This system must be able
    to take care of replicating databases across all the parts of this
    "distributed computer" and propagating updates.
</UL>
In addition to the DotGNU Platform, we are also working on a
<A href="auth.htm">DotGNU Virtual Identities</A> system.  This system
will eventually run as an application on the DotGNU Platform, but we
are also working on a quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept implementation
that can already be made available before the DotGNU Platform if
available.

Platform, please subscribe to
