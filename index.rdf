	<title>April 27-4-2004: libjit-0.0.0f has been released</title>
	<link>http://www.southern-storm.com.au/libjit.html</link>

The libjit library implements Just-In-Time compilation functionality. Unlike 
other JIT's, this one is designed to be independent of any particular virtual 
machine bytecode format or language. The hope is that Free Software projects 
can get a leg-up on proprietary VM vendors by using this library rather than 
spending large amounts of time writing their own JIT from scratch.

This JIT is also designed to be portable to multiple architectures. If you run 
libjit on a machine for which a native code generator is not yet available, 
then libjit will fall back to interpreting the code. This way, you don't need 
to write your own interpreter for your bytecode format if you don't want to.

libjit is independent of pnet (that's one of the main points!) but we'll
eventually modify pnet to use it for JIT'ing.

	<title>March 13-3-2004: DotGNU Portable.NET 0.6.4 released</title>
	<link>http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html</link>
Portable.NET 0.6.4 and Treecc 0.3.0 have been released.  The big change this
cycle is the C compiler, which has now reached the point of being useful.  We
now need lots of volunteers to help flesh out the C library, pnetC, to include
all of the usual libc features.  There have also been a lot of bug fixes and
performance improvements in System.Windows.Forms, thanks to Neil Cawse.  And
Richard Baumann has completely rewritten the System.Xml parser, fixing many
long-standing issues with the XML library.

	<title>March 6-3-2004: C Compiler: Significant Progress and Call For Volunteers</title>
	<link>http://www.southern-storm.com.au/docs/pnettools_3.html#SEC21</link>
The new C compiler type system has been checked in.  Type layout is
now totally dynamic; the IL binary will automatically adapt itself
to the runtime engine it is running on.  This means that DotGNU is
bringing true "write once, run anywhere" functionality to C,
running on top of standard CLR implementations.  Unlike Microsoft's
C compiler, whose output will only run on i386-based Windows
systems, ours will run portable ANSI C code on any platform that
has a CLR, be it 32-bit or 64-bit, little-endian or big.

Simple examples of C programs can be compiled to IL now, and
volunteers are needed to work on the standard C library so that
more programs and libraries can be compiled.  Our eventual goal is
to bring a large body of Free Software libraries and programs to
the CLI environment, vastly increasing the range of functionality
beyond the small number of libraries currently defined for C#.

	<title>November 2-11-2003: Embedding X applications in Xsharp</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/screenshot12.html</link>
It is now possible to embed any X application as a child widget within an 
Xsharp application.  This screenshot shows both "gedit" (a GNOME app) and
	"kcalc" (a KDE app) running as two children of the same Xsharp main
	window.  The pnetlib CVS tree includes "XClockEmbed.cs" as an
example of doing this for "xclock".  This feature is important because the
next version of WinForms will have a HTML web browser control widget, and
we will want to embed an existing third-part Free Software web browser, and
not write a web browser from scratch in C#.

	<title>October 10-10-2003: Feature freeze</title>
	A feature freeze for Portable.NET is now in effect, leading up to
	the DotGNU 0.1 release, which will be "really soon now".
	During feature freeze, bugs in existing code will be fixed if they are
	either easy to do, or there is no way for a programmer to work around
	them.  Anything that may impact stability will be deferred until after
	DotGNU 0.1.

	in the area of collaboratively implementing
	System.Windows.Forms.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/irc.html</link>
	At today's irc meeting, the release date for DotGNU 0.1
	has been fixed at end-September.  For Portable.NET the
	goals are to get pnetC to basic usefulness, fix as many
	system.xml bugs as we can, and make the core button/textbox/scroll
	widgets work in winforms.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-July/011079.html</link>
	Breaking the tradition, which required a 0.6.0 this time , the 
	pnet developers have decided to put out 0.5.10, 0.5.12, etc, 
	as release candidates for 0.6.0, which will be part of DotGNU 0.1.
	Major changes in threading, windows.forms , managed C compiler and
	CVM/Unroller core. Downloads available from

	Gardens Point Component Pascal (GPCP) works with Portable.net. 
	GPCP is interesting because the compiler and runtime are completely 
	hosted inside the CLI environment, using ilasm to generate the 
	output binaries.

	<title>July 14-07-2003: PPC Speed Gains in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/pnet-developers/2003-July/000405.html</link>
	 Portable.NET on the PPC has recently doubled in speed due to the
	 use of manual register assignments on that platform. The speed gains
	 will be noticeable once the PPC unroller port has been completed.

	<title>July 12-07-2003: Generic Unroller in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/pnet-developers/2003-July/000399.html</link>
	 The generic unroller has finally hit pnet cvs. The unroller is
	 responsible for producing native code (much like a JIT) for the pnet
	 runtime. The generic unroller separates the CPU specific details of
	 native code generation, like opcode values and register ordering, from
	 generic features, like register allocation, greatly simplifying the
	 process of porting the unroller to new platforms. The ARM and x86
	 ports are already working and support for IA-64, PPC, and Alpha is in
	 the works.

	<title>June 17-06-2003: Portable.NET 0.5.8 released</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-June/010763.html</link>
A lot of things have happened since the last Portable.NET release.  The Java
and Visual Basic language front-ends for cscc have been added to the system,
and a huge number of new classes have been implemented in pnetlib, including
support for IPv6 and IrDA networking.

We have also begun implementation of the System.Windows.Forms library,
built on top of the X11 library.  This means that it will be able to run
on any X11-capable system.  Currently tested to work on x86-based GNU/Linux
systems and ppc-based MacOS X systems.

We are looking for volunteers to help us implement the "x11-winforms"
library as quickly as possible, and to test it on as many platforms as
possible.

Finally, the ml-pnet project has been started to provide ports of certain
Mono C# libraries.  System.Data (ADO.NET) currently works, and we hope to
have System.Web (ASP.NET) working soon.

	<title>June 2-06-2003: WinForms support for Portable.net</title>
	<link>http://www.dotgnu.org/screenshot3.html</link>
	Portable.net has started work on the System.Windows.Forms namespace
	and a simple forms example has been run on the platform. The WinForms
	effort is to proceed as a new lightweight toolkit based on System.Drawing
	rather than as a UI wrapper system. This will allow it to be compatible
	to the specifications even when the native UI is different. Currently 
	a system based on X11 drawing apis is being developed.

	<title>May 29-05-2003: Support for IPv6 and IrDA protocols</title>
	Portable.NET now has support for IPv6 (the "next generation" internet
	protocol which fixes a number of problems with the current version,
	in particular the limited number of available IPv4 addresses) and
	the IrDA sockets protocol (so that now you can use DotGNU to build
	networks between infrared capable handhelds and workstations).  With
	Portable.NET, IrDA is supported in all versions where the OS kernel
	supports it, not just handhelds.  (This differs from Microsoft's
	version of .NET where IrDa capability is not available in the
	workstation-level SDK.)

	Following a complaint that a Brainfuck compiler
	was still missing in DotGNU's compiler collection, such a compiler was
	quickly created, together with a demo webservice that is implemented in
	the Brainfuck language.  The code is in pnet cvs and can serve as a

	Rhys has written a CVM code unroller for ARM/StrongARM platforms.
	An unroller uses some simple JIT techniques to translate commonly-used
	CVM instructions into native code.  The result is about a 2-3 times
	improvement in performance on ARM, compared with the default direct
