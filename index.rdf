        <title>March 04-03-2006: DotGNU website redesign</title>
        <link>http://dotgnu.org/</link>
        <description>
We are currently looking at redesigning dotgnu.org and building a new look and feel. The old template system is also going to
be replaced with an XSLT based one. If you are interested in helping, please join up on the #dotgnu IRC channel or mail the
developers mailing list, we are very interested in general proposals and mockups.

        <title>February 11-02-2006: Linux.conf.au 2006</title>
        <link>http://dotgnu.org/</link>
        <description>
Some DotGNU developers met at this year's Linux.conf.au in Dunedin, NZ to discuss plans for 2006.
Apart from a nice dessert, there was also quite some discussion about Portable.NET's future. The conclusion was
to go ahead and give Portable.NET a big boost in 2006 as there is a lot of exciting technology in Portable.NET
to play around with.

	<title>December 05-12-2004: Video clip of DotGNU running on Encore Simputer</title>
	<link>http://t3.dotgnu.info/code/Dotgnu_Simputer.avi</link>
	<description>
DotGNU Portable.NET has been ported to the Encore Simputer, a handheld computer based on on Intel's StrongARM
CPU (a RISC microprocessor designed for embedded applications), within 72 hours after the release of Encore's
port of the GNU/Linux development tools for this platform at the "Linux Bangalore/2004" conference.
Conference organiser Atul Chitnis said, ''I threw the challenge as a joke, the bet being a cup of coffee.
Gopal borrowed a PC at the conference, and finally an Encore Simputer, and came to me on the third day, saying
that I now owed him a cup of coffee. It took a few seconds before the enormity of that statement hit me.''

Even though Rhys was on "sabbatical" away from Portable.NET
during this release cycle (he has been working on libjit),
major progress has been made in many areas, including in
particular threading, Winforms, System.Xml, ml-pnet, DCOP
and serialization.

        <description>
Rhys has packaged up the current state of the libjit tree into a
libjit 0.0.2 release.

Libjit is now at the state where primary testing and bug fixing can begin.  We 
initially need test cases that cover all of the functions in "jit-insn.h".

The easiest way to write a test case is to write a small program in the 
"Dynamic Pascal" language that exercises the feature in question.  Then place 
it into the "libjit/tests" directory.  The "libjit/tests/README" file 
contains more information on how to do this.  A couple of test cases are 
already provided that demonstrate the concept.

	<title>April 27-4-2004: libjit-0.0.0f has been released</title>
	<link>http://www.southern-storm.com.au/libjit.html</link>
        <description>
The libjit library implements Just-In-Time compilation functionality. Unlike 
other JIT's, this one is designed to be independent of any particular virtual 
machine bytecode format or language. The hope is that Free Software projects 
can get a leg-up on proprietary VM vendors by using this library rather than 
spending large amounts of time writing their own JIT from scratch.

This JIT is also designed to be portable to multiple architectures. If you run 
libjit on a machine for which a native code generator is not yet available, 
then libjit will fall back to interpreting the code. This way, you don't need 
to write your own interpreter for your bytecode format if you don't want to.

libjit is independent of pnet (that's one of the main points!) but we'll
eventually modify pnet to use it for JIT'ing.

	<title>March 13-3-2004: DotGNU Portable.NET 0.6.4 released</title>
	<link>http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html</link>
	<description>Portable.NET 0.6.4 and Treecc 0.3.0 have been released.  The big change this
cycle is the C compiler, which has now reached the point of being useful.  We
now need lots of volunteers to help flesh out the C library, pnetC, to include
all of the usual libc features.  There have also been a lot of bug fixes and
performance improvements in System.Windows.Forms, thanks to Neil Cawse.  And
Richard Baumann has completely rewritten the System.Xml parser, fixing many
long-standing issues with the XML library.

	<title>March 6-3-2004: C Compiler: Significant Progress and Call For Volunteers</title>
	<link>http://www.southern-storm.com.au/docs/pnettools_3.html#SEC21</link>
	<description>The new C compiler type system has been checked in.  Type layout is
now totally dynamic; the IL binary will automatically adapt itself
to the runtime engine it is running on.  This means that DotGNU is
bringing true "write once, run anywhere" functionality to C,
running on top of standard CLR implementations.  Unlike Microsoft's
C compiler, whose output will only run on i386-based Windows
systems, ours will run portable ANSI C code on any platform that
has a CLR, be it 32-bit or 64-bit, little-endian or big.

Simple examples of C programs can be compiled to IL now, and
volunteers are needed to work on the standard C library so that
more programs and libraries can be compiled.  Our eventual goal is
to bring a large body of Free Software libraries and programs to
the CLI environment, vastly increasing the range of functionality
beyond the small number of libraries currently defined for C#.

	<title>November 2-11-2003: Embedding X applications in Xsharp</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/screenshot12.html</link>
	<description>It is now possible to embed any X application as a child widget within an 
Xsharp application.  This screenshot shows both "gedit" (a GNOME app) and
	"kcalc" (a KDE app) running as two children of the same Xsharp main
	window.  The pnetlib CVS tree includes "XClockEmbed.cs" as an
example of doing this for "xclock".  This feature is important because the
next version of WinForms will have a HTML web browser control widget, and
we will want to embed an existing third-part Free Software web browser, and
not write a web browser from scratch in C#.
