	<title>October 16-10-2003: DotGNU Portable.NET 0.6.0 released</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-October/011609.html</link>
	Version 0.6.0 of
	DotGNU Portable.NET has been released.  This is the release which will
	go onto the DotGNU 0.1 CD.  It contains lots of bug fixes,
	functionality was missing in earlier versions, and huge improvements
        in System.Windows.Forms.

	<title>October 10-10-2003: Feature freeze</title>
	A feature freeze for Portable.NET is now in effect, leading up to
	the DotGNU 0.1 release, which will be "really soon now".
	During feature freeze, bugs in existing code will be fixed if they are
	either easy to do, or there is no way for a programmer to work around
	them.  Anything that may impact stability will be deferred until after
	DotGNU 0.1.

	on the Microsoft Windows System.  This is a major achievement
	in the area of portability.

	<title>August 26-08-2003: 1st International DotGNU Collaborative Coding Competition</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/competition.html</link>
	The DotGNU project is holding an international competition
	in the area of collaboratively implementing
	System.Windows.Forms.
	Besides the chance of winning one of fifteen monetary prizes
	totalling US$ 4500, participants get the good feeling of having
	contributed to setting the IT world free from the dominion of a
	certain monopolistic company.

	<title>August 09-08-2003: DotGNU 0.1 to be released end-September</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/irc.html</link>
	At today's irc meeting, the release date for DotGNU 0.1
	has been fixed at end-September.  For Portable.NET the
	goals are to get pnetC to basic usefulness, fix as many
	system.xml bugs as we can, and make the core button/textbox/scroll
	widgets work in winforms.

	<title>July 26-07-2003: Portable.NET 0.5.10 released</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-July/011079.html</link>
	Breaking the tradition, which required a 0.6.0 this time , the 
	pnet developers have decided to put out 0.5.10, 0.5.12, etc, 
	as release candidates for 0.6.0, which will be part of DotGNU 0.1.
	Major changes in threading, windows.forms , managed C compiler and
	CVM/Unroller core. Downloads available from 
	http://dotgnu.org/downloads.html .

	<title>July 24-07-2003: Portable.net runs Component Pascal </title>
	<link> http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-July/011047.html </link>
	Gardens Point Component Pascal (GPCP) works with Portable.net. 
	GPCP is interesting because the compiler and runtime are completely 
	hosted inside the CLI environment, using ilasm to generate the 
	output binaries.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-July/011014.html</link>
	TreeCC 0.2.6 was released with minor modifications , which
	adds an additional GC allocated node model to the original HEAP 
	allocated (malloc) model and namespace support to C++ output.

	<title>July 14-07-2003: PPC Speed Gains in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/pnet-developers/2003-July/000405.html</link>
	 Portable.NET on the PPC has recently doubled in speed due to the
	 use of manual register assignments on that platform. The speed gains
	 will be noticeable once the PPC unroller port has been completed.

	<title>July 12-07-2003: Generic Unroller in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/pnet-developers/2003-July/000399.html</link>
	 The generic unroller has finally hit pnet cvs. The unroller is
	 responsible for producing native code (much like a JIT) for the pnet
	 runtime. The generic unroller separates the CPU specific details of
	 native code generation, like opcode values and register ordering, from
	 generic features, like register allocation, greatly simplifying the
	 process of porting the unroller to new platforms. The ARM and x86
	 ports are already working and support for IA-64, PPC, and Alpha is in
	 the works.

	<title>July 05-07-2003: DotGNU Manifesto</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/manifesto.html</link>
	 The DotGNU Manifesto is now official, and consequently the version
	 number has been changed to 1.0. (There are no other changes from draft
	 version 0.4).

	<title>June 29-06-2003: Threading in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>

	 Thanks to the works of Thong Nguyen (tum), threading is working in
	 DotGNU Portable.NET now.

	<title>June 17-06-2003: Portable.NET 0.5.8 released</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-June/010763.html</link>
A lot of things have happened since the last Portable.NET release.  The Java
and Visual Basic language front-ends for cscc have been added to the system,
and a huge number of new classes have been implemented in pnetlib, including
support for IPv6 and IrDA networking.

We have also begun implementation of the System.Windows.Forms library,
built on top of the X11 library.  This means that it will be able to run
on any X11-capable system.  Currently tested to work on x86-based GNU/Linux
systems and ppc-based MacOS X systems.

We are looking for volunteers to help us implement the "x11-winforms"
library as quickly as possible, and to test it on as many platforms as
possible.

Finally, the ml-pnet project has been started to provide ports of certain
Mono C# libraries.  System.Data (ADO.NET) currently works, and we hope to
have System.Web (ASP.NET) working soon.

	<title>June 2-06-2003: WinForms support for Portable.net</title>
	<link>http://www.dotgnu.org/screenshot3.html</link>
	Portable.net has started work on the System.Windows.Forms namespace
	and a simple forms example has been run on the platform. The WinForms
	effort is to proceed as a new lightweight toolkit based on System.Drawing
	rather than as a UI wrapper system. This will allow it to be compatible
	to the specifications even when the native UI is different. Currently 
	a system based on X11 drawing apis is being developed.

	<title>May 29-05-2003: Support for IPv6 and IrDA protocols</title>
	Portable.NET now has support for IPv6 (the "next generation" internet
	protocol which fixes a number of problems with the current version,
	in particular the limited number of available IPv4 addresses) and
	the IrDA sockets protocol (so that now you can use DotGNU to build
	networks between infrared capable handhelds and workstations).  With
	Portable.NET, IrDA is supported in all versions where the OS kernel
	supports it, not just handhelds.  (This differs from Microsoft's
	version of .NET where IrDa capability is not available in the
	workstation-level SDK.)

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pnetlib-status/</link>
	The pnetlib-status pages have been updated to include comparisons to 
	the .NET 1.1 standard. Only 474 classes to go, so please pick a class , 
	any class and lend a hand. We're nearly there !.

	Version 0.0.2 of the DotGNU JAVA compiler has been released and
	integrated in to pnet cvs.

	<title>May 17-05-2003: Brainfuck compiler and demo webservice</title>
	<link>http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/</link>
	Following a complaint that a Brainfuck compiler
	was still missing in DotGNU's compiler collection, such a compiler was
	quickly created, together with a demo webservice that is implemented in
	the Brainfuck language.  The code is in pnet cvs and can serve as a
	simple example of a cscc plugin.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010575.html</link>
	The beginnings of Visual Basic.NET support are now in pnet cvs.
	If you would like to help out on the VB project, then there is lots of
	work still to do, some of which is suitable for beginners.

	<title>May 05-05-2003: Code unroller for ARM CPUs available</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010505.html</link>
	Rhys has written a CVM code unroller for ARM/StrongARM platforms.
	An unroller uses some simple JIT techniques to translate commonly-used
	CVM instructions into native code.  The result is about a 2-3 times
	improvement in performance on ARM, compared with the default direct
	threaded configuration.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010501.html</link>	Besides "mscorlib.dll" being now 100% signature compatible with the
	corresponding assembly in version 1.1 (see previous news item), the
	other big news is that the library can now be built in multiple
	configurations.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-April/010460.html</link>
	The lowest-level library within pnetlib, "mscorlib.dll", is 
	now signature compatible with the corresponding assembly in version 1.1 of 
	the .NET Framework SDK.  Every class, every method, every interop marker 
	attribute, and every silly little enumerated constant.  All of it!
