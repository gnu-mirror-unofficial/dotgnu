	<title>July 18-07-2003: TreeCC 0.2.6 released</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-July/011014.html</link>
	TreeCC 0.2.6 was released with minor modifications , which
	adds an additional GC allocated node model to the original HEAP 
	allocated (malloc) model and namespace support to C++ output.
	Other minor bug fixes and improvements go along. Read the full
	announcement

	<title>July 14-07-2003: PPC Speed Gains in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/pnet-developers/2003-July/000405.html</link>
	 Portable.NET on the PPC has recently doubled in speed due to the
	 use of manual register assignments on that platform. The speed gains
	 will be noticeable once the PPC unroller port has been completed.

	<title>July 12-07-2003: Generic Unroller in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/pnet-developers/2003-July/000399.html</link>
	 The generic unroller has finally hit pnet cvs. The unroller is
	 responsible for producing native code (much like a JIT) for the pnet
	 runtime. The generic unroller separates the CPU specific details of
	 native code generation, like opcode values and register ordering, from
	 generic features, like register allocation, greatly simplifying the
	 process of porting the unroller to new platforms. The ARM and x86
	 ports are already working and support for IA-64, PPC, and Alpha is in
	 the works.

	<title>July 05-07-2003: DotGNU Manifesto</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/manifesto.html</link>
	 The DotGNU Manifesto is now official, and consequently the version
	 number has been changed to 1.0. (There are no other changes from draft
	 version 0.4).

	<title>June 29-06-2003: Threading in DotGNU Portable.NET</title>

	 Thanks to the works of Thong Nguyen (tum), threading is working in
	 DotGNU Portable.NET now.

	<title>June 17-06-2003: Portable.NET 0.5.8 released</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-June/010763.html</link>
A lot of things have happened since the last Portable.NET release.  The Java
and Visual Basic language front-ends for cscc have been added to the system,
and a huge number of new classes have been implemented in pnetlib, including
support for IPv6 and IrDA networking.

We have also begun implementation of the System.Windows.Forms library,
built on top of the X11 library.  This means that it will be able to run
on any X11-capable system.  Currently tested to work on x86-based GNU/Linux
systems and ppc-based MacOS X systems.

We are looking for volunteers to help us implement the "x11-winforms"
library as quickly as possible, and to test it on as many platforms as
possible.

Finally, the ml-pnet project has been started to provide ports of certain
Mono C# libraries.  System.Data (ADO.NET) currently works, and we hope to
have System.Web (ASP.NET) working soon.

	<title>June 2-06-2003: WinForms support for Portable.net</title>
	<link>http://www.dotgnu.org/screenshot3.html</link>
	Portable.net has started work on the System.Windows.Forms namespace
	and a simple forms example has been run on the platform. The WinForms
	effort is to proceed as a new lightweight toolkit based on System.Drawing
	rather than as a UI wrapper system. This will allow it to be compatible
	to the specifications even when the native UI is different. Currently 
	a system based on X11 drawing apis is being developed.

	<title>May 29-05-2003: Support for IPv6 and IrDA protocols</title>
	Portable.NET now has support for IPv6 (the "next generation" internet
	protocol which fixes a number of problems with the current version,
	in particular the limited number of available IPv4 addresses) and
	the IrDA sockets protocol (so that now you can use DotGNU to build
	networks between infrared capable handhelds and workstations).  With
	Portable.NET, IrDA is supported in all versions where the OS kernel
	supports it, not just handhelds.  (This differs from Microsoft's
	version of .NET where IrDa capability is not available in the
	workstation-level SDK.)

	The pnetlib-status pages have been updated to include comparisons to 
	the .NET 1.1 standard. Only 474 classes to go, so please pick a class , 
	any class and lend a hand. We're nearly there !.

	<title>May 17-05-2003: Brainfuck compiler and demo webservice</title>
	<link>http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/</link>
	Following a complaint that a Brainfuck compiler
	was still missing in DotGNU's compiler collection, such a compiler was
	quickly created, together with a demo webservice that is implemented in
	the Brainfuck language.  The code is in pnet cvs and can serve as a
	simple example of a cscc plugin.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010575.html</link>
	The beginnings of Visual Basic.NET support are now in pnet cvs.
	If you would like to help out on the VB project, then there is lots of
	work still to do, some of which is suitable for beginners.

	<title>May 05-05-2003: Code unroller for ARM CPUs available</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010505.html</link>
	Rhys has written a CVM code unroller for ARM/StrongARM platforms.
	An unroller uses some simple JIT techniques to translate commonly-used
	CVM instructions into native code.  The result is about a 2-3 times
	improvement in performance on ARM, compared with the default direct
	threaded configuration.

	corresponding assembly in version 1.1 (see previous news item), the
	other big news is that the library can now be built in multiple
	configurations.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-April/010460.html</link>
	The lowest-level library within pnetlib, "mscorlib.dll", is 
	now signature compatible with the corresponding assembly in version 1.1 of 
	the .NET Framework SDK.  Every class, every method, every interop marker 
	attribute, and every silly little enumerated constant.  All of it!

		its subprojects. Adam Ballai has been central to this
		development and has set this up . So everyone is invited to
		chip in and go wiki.

	<description>
		The DotGNU Portable.net base tools now have support for Generic IL.
		Portable.NET is the first Free Software implementation of the CLI
		to release real support for Generic IL. It includes the assembler
		and disassembler for now. The compiler is being worked upon to
		support generic C# in the near future.
