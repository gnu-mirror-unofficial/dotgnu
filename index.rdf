	<link>http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/</link>
	Following a complaint that a Brainfuck compiler

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010505.html</link>
	Rhys has written a CVM code unroller for ARM/StrongARM platforms.
	An unroller uses some simple JIT techniques to translate commonly-used
	CVM instructions into native code.  The result is about a 2-3 times
	improvement in performance on ARM, compared with the default direct
	threaded configuration.
