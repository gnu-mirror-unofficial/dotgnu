	<title>June 13-06-2003: WinForms support for Portable.net </title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-June/010715.html</link>
	Portable.net has started work on the System.Windows.Forms namespace
	and a simple forms example has been run on the platform. The WinForms
	effort is to proceed as a new lightweight toolkit based on System.Drawing
	rather than as a UI wrapper system. This will allow it to be compatible
	to the specifications even when the native UI is different. Currently 
	a system based on X11 drawing apis is being developed. A screenshot has
	been uploaded to http://symonds.net/~gopalv82/code/screen2-2.jpg.

	The DotGNU Portable.net project now has added a full capability
	Managed Postgresql Provider thanks to the efforts of the Npgsql
	project admin Francisco Figueiredo Jr. The detailed instructions
	are available from the Npgsql News Page.

	<title>May 29-05-2003: Support for IPv6 and IrDA protocols</title>
	Portable.NET now has support for IPv6 (the "next generation" internet
	protocol which fixes a number of problems with the current version,
	in particular the limited number of available IPv4 addresses) and
	the IrDA sockets protocol (so that now you can use DotGNU to build
	networks between infrared capable handhelds and workstations).  With
	Portable.NET, IrDA is supported in all versions where the OS kernel
	supports it, not just handhelds.  (This differs from Microsoft's
	version of .NET where IrDa capability is not available in the
	workstation-level SDK.)

	The pnetlib-status pages have been updated to include comparisons to 
	the .NET 1.1 standard. Only 474 classes to go, so please pick a class , 
	any class and lend a hand. We're nearly there !.

	<title>May 17-05-2003: Brainfuck compiler and demo webservice</title>
	<link>http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/</link>
	Following a complaint that a Brainfuck compiler
	was still missing in DotGNU's compiler collection, such a compiler was
	quickly created, together with a demo webservice that is implemented in
	the Brainfuck language.  The code is in pnet cvs and can serve as a
	simple example of a cscc plugin.

	<title>May 05-05-2003: Code unroller for ARM CPUs available</title>
	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010505.html</link>
	Rhys has written a CVM code unroller for ARM/StrongARM platforms.
	An unroller uses some simple JIT techniques to translate commonly-used
	CVM instructions into native code.  The result is about a 2-3 times
	improvement in performance on ARM, compared with the default direct
	threaded configuration.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-May/010501.html</link>	Besides "mscorlib.dll" being now 100% signature compatible with the
	corresponding assembly in version 1.1 (see previous news item), the
	other big news is that the library can now be built in multiple
	configurations.

	<link>http://dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2003-April/010460.html</link>
	The lowest-level library within pnetlib, "mscorlib.dll", is 
	now signature compatible with the corresponding assembly in version 1.1 of 
	the .NET Framework SDK.  Every class, every method, every interop marker 
	attribute, and every silly little enumerated constant.  All of it!
