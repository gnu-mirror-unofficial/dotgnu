<H1>DotGNU Virtual Identities</H1>
The DotGNU Virtual Identities system will eventually run as an
application on the <A href="arch.htm">DotGNU Platform</A>, but we are
also working on a quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept implementation that
can already be made available before the DotGNU Platform if available.
<P>
This project is responsible for creating functionality that gives
end-users a lot of convenience in filling out registration forms
etc, while at the same time giving the end-user full control about
what data will be supplied.
<P>
We must NOT create a passport "portal".  That is technically and
morally wrong.  We must create a framework that can be scaled and
deployed at any level desired, whether locally, at an enterprise,
or at a portal.  Authentication and access to private information
should be peer to peer to preserve local storage of those things
which should remain in private users hands.  The ability to migrate
data upward can be provided for, on a selective basis, and controls
must be provided as to who may or may not access specific user
information.
<P>
For extremely high reliability (avoiding any single point of
failure) this framework can be run on top of the DotGNU
Distributed Execution Environment.  (For more information about this
please refer to the <A href="arch.htm">DotGNU Platform</A> page.)
