<H1>Subprojects of the DotGNU Meta-Project</H1>
The <A href="index.htm">DotGNU Project</a> is so big that for
practical reasons we are planning to divide it into ten to twenty
subprojects.  The details of this subdivision are currently being
discussed on the
<A href="http://dotgnu.org/mailman/listinfo/developers">
   DotGNU developers mailing list</A>.  In order to get started
with contributing to the DotGNU project, please subscribe to this
mailing list, introduce yourself and state what subproject you would
like to contribute to.
<P>
If you feel up to it, you are also welcome to propose a new subproject
and volunteer to lead it.

  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Core Platform</STRONG>
    <P>
    This project is responsible for creating the DotGNU bytecode
    specification, DotGNU bytecode interpreter, DotGNU
    bytecode->machine code compiler (may be based on gcc), and a
    compiler from a subset of one popular programming language
    (perhaps Java?) to DotGNU bytecode.
    <P>
    This is a high-priority project.  Support for generating DotGNU
    bytecode will be added to the Free Software implementations of
    compilers by many programming languages by other subprojects of
    the DotGNU project.  This "DotGNU Core Platform" project will
    create a well-documented specification for "DotGNU bytecode" so that
    all everyone who develops or maintains a compiler can add support
    for generating DotGNU bytecode.
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Secure Execution Environment</STRONG>
    <P>
    This project is responsible for creating a Secure Execution
    Environment which can download DotGNU bytecode (or other stuff for
    which an emulation is available - that should include .NET stuff)
    from the network and execute it in a secure manner.
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Distributed Execution Environment</STRONG>
    <P>
    DotGNU's Distributed Execution Environment will be like an
    operating system for a "distributed computer" consisting of
    several instances of the "DotGNU Secure Execution Environment"
    that are running on several computers.  This system must be able
    to take care of replicating databases across all the parts of this
    "distributed computer" and propagating updates.
  <LI><STRONG>DotGNU Virtual Identities</STRONG>
    <P>
    This project is responsible for creating functionality that gives
    end-users a lot of convenience in filling out registration forms
    etc, while at the same time giving the end-user full control about
    what data will be supplied.
    <P>
    We must NOT create a passport "portal".  That is technically and
    morally wrong.  We must create a framework that can be scaled and
    deployed at any level desired, whether locally, at an enterprise,
    or at a portal.  Authentication and access to private information
    should be peer to peer to preserve local storage of those things
    which should remain in private users hands.  The ability to migrate
    data upward can be provided for, on a selective basis, and controls
    must be provided as to who may or may not access specific user
    information.
    <P>
    For extremely high reliability (avoiding any single point of
    failure) this framework can be run on top of the DotGNU
    Distributed Execution Environment.
