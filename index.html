 GNU Freedom for the Net
</h1>
<p>
 The mission of the DotGNU project is to defeat the
<a href="danger.html">monopolistic threat</a> of 
Microsoft's .NET by creating a competing
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
 platform which is compatible enough with .NET to make
 migration reasonably easy.
 We say: &quot;Ok, MS you are pushing webservices and C# and IL because you want
 to catch everyone in your dotNET, but
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">GNU</a> is taking
 precisely that  technology and using it to <a href="freedom.html">set
 the world free</a> from your monopolies.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 We invite individuals and businesses worldwide to join us in a collaborative
 effort to create a development and webservices platform that truly meets the
 needs of its users.
</p>
<p>
 <b>SPECIAL: Check out the <a href="competition.html">Coding Competition</a>
 with thousands of dollars of prize money.</b>
</p>
<p>
 So far, not too much has been happening in this competition.  Therefore, if
 you enter the race now, your chances of winning the $2000 first prize are
 still quite intact!
</p>
<p>
 DotGNU currently consists of three main development projects (<a href="join.html">further components will be added over time</a>):
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="./pnet.html">DotGNU Portable.NET</a>, which builds a suite
   of compilers (the currently supported languages are C#, C and BF, with
   VB and Java support in the works), C# class library, and related
   development tools.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.phpgroupware.org/">phpGroupWare</a>, a multi-user web-based GroupWare
   suite, which also serves to provide a good collection of webservice
   components, all of which can be accessed through XML-RPC so that you can
   easily integrate them into webservice applications of your own.
  </li>
  <li>
   The <a href="./dgee.html">DGEE</a> webservice server is also moving forward
   nicely.
  </li>
 </ul>

</a>
<p>
Support for the upcoming &quot;Whidbey&quot; System.Console routines has been added to 
Portable.NET, and there is a simple &quot;Snake&quot; game that demonstrates how to 
use it.  A screenshot is <a href="screenshot13.html">here</a>

	<h2>November 2-11-2003: Embedding X applications in Xsharp</h2>
</a>
<p>
It is now possible to embed any X application as a child widget within an 
Xsharp application.  The pnetlib CVS tree includes &quot;XClockEmbed.cs&quot; as an 
example of doing this for &quot;xclock&quot;, and <a href="screenshot12.html">this
screenshot</a> shows both &quot;gedit&quot; (a GNOME app) and &quot;kcalc&quot; (a KDE app) running
as two children of the same Xsharp main window.  This is important because the
next version of WinForms will have a HTML web browser control widget, and
we will want to embed an existing third-part Free Software web browser, and
not write a web browser from scratch in C#.

	During feature freeze, bugs in existing code will be fixed if they are

<p>
	At today's irc meeting, the release date for DotGNU 0.1
	has been fixed at end-September.  For Portable.NET the
	goals are to get pnetC to basic usefulness, fix as many

</a>
<p>
	Breaking the tradition, which required a 0.6.0 this time , the 
	pnet developers have decided to put out 0.5.10, 0.5.12, etc, 
	as release candidates for 0.6.0, which will be part of DotGNU 0.1.
</p>
<p>
	A lot has happened this release.  The System.Windows.Forms namespace is
	coming along well. The DotGNU community has chipped in more than its
	fair share of it this release - particularly Simon Guindon, Neil Cawse, 
	Richard Baumann, Ian Fung, Cecilio Pardo, and the relentless Gopal V.
	Threading now works very well (thanks to Thong Nguyen aka tum) and 
	Reflection.Emit (Richard Baumann) too. The C compiler has advanced 
	enough to compile most C programs. The pnetC now has significant bits
	of glibc and is looking for people to help port the rest of glibc here.
	The CVM unroller was also rewritten into a generic framework that should
	be much easier to port to new architectures.

support for IPv6 and IrDA networking.

on any X11-capable system.  Currently tested to work on x86-based GNU/Linux
systems and ppc-based MacOS X systems.

We are looking for volunteers to help us implement the &quot;x11-winforms&quot;
library as quickly as possible, and to test it on as many platforms as
possible.

Finally, the ml-pnet project has been started to provide ports of certain
