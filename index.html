<h1>
 DotGNU - Making the Web Work for You!
</h1>
<p>
 We're building something that could be called an "operating system
 for the internet" - a collection of tools that allow software
 components to interact with each other over the internet.  The
 most impressive parts are currently
 <a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">DotGNU
 Portable.NET</a> which builds a C# compiler, class library, and
 related development tools, and
 <a href="http://www.phpgroupware.org/">phpGroupWare</a>, a multi-user
 web-based GroupWare suite, which also serves to provide a good
 collection of webservice components, all of which can be accessed
 through XML-RPC so that you can easily integrate them into webservice
 applications of your own.
</p>
<p>
 DotGNU, a project of FreeDevelopers and GNU, is really a meta-project
 that will consist of a good number of such
 <a href="projects.html">software development projects</a>.
 The main objectives of DotGNU are to build a
 <a href="arch.html">webservices platform</a> and a
 <a href="auth.html">Virtual Identities</a> system.
</p>
<h1>
 DotGNU - Keeping You from Getting Tangled in a Net!
</h1>
<p>
 The DotGNU project was originally started in reaction to Microsoft's
 .NET strategy, for which it will be a complete replacement (and not
 just a Free Software implementation). The parts of .NET strategy about
 which we are most concerned are Microsoft's attempts to gain control of
 the internet and its users. Parts of this strategy, including the plan
 to unleash a
 <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a//p2p/2001/05/30/hailstorm.html">"Hailstorm"</a>
 have been dropped,
 <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/04/11/023259.shtml?tid=109">because
 all the major companies which sell services to consumers have realised
 that this "Hailstorm" would not be good for them.</a> On other fronts,
 Microsoft is still working hard to entangle everyone in their .NET --
 In contrast, the goal of DotGNU is to give computer users full freedom
 to use the internet as they want.  For example, the DotGNU approach to 
 <a href="web-services.html">"web services"</a> will make it possible
 for end users to run webservice software on their own PC, so that the
 users are not forced to migrate their data to the webservice servers.
</p>
<p>
 DotGNU will use a decentralized paradigm:  No single company, server or
 entity will control authorization.  This avoids privacy problems like
 those recently pointed out in
 <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/consumer/microsoft/stateagletter.html">a
 letter from the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) on
 Microsoft's Passport system.</a>
</p>
<p>
 Furthermore, DotGNU will emphasize security, it will use encryption
 wherever possible to keep user data secure and hidden. (According to
 the article <a href="http://avirubin.com/passport.html">Risks of the
 Passport Single Signon Protocol</a>[1], Microsoft's approach has some
 fundamental problems in the area of security.  In fact it appears that
 <a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2814881,00.html">Microsoft
 is storing the password and username for Passport as clear text</a>,
 a huge security risk.)  Because of entirely unrelated, serious
 security problems,
 <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,48105,00.html">Microsoft
 was forced on Nov 2, 2001 to disabled the "virtual wallet" function of
 the Passport service</a> as Marc Slemko
 <a href="http://alive.znep.com/~marcs/passport/">published a sample
 exploit that demonstrates a cross-site scripting vulnerability.</a>
</p>
<p>
 There are no real remaining traditional competitors to MS, and the US
 government recently failed to contain MS, so the field is left to us. MS has
 announced that it has "bet the company" on .Net, because "Webservices"
 represents the future, and Windows and MS Office will become progressively
 less important. So DotGNU stands between where MS is and where it wants to
 be. Therefore DotGNU and .Net represents the ultimate showdown between
 proprietary and Free Software.
</p>
<h2>
 Don't read unpublished Microsoft information
</h2>
<p>
 In order to avoid falling into any legal traps, please be extremely
 careful to avoid reading any unpublished information from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
 We ask every contributor to disclose exactly how much exposure they've
 had to Microsoft stuff, and make them commit to report any additional
 exposure immediately.  Whenever there is even the slightest shade of a
 possible problem,  the contributor needs to refrain from contributing
 until our legal team has been established and it has provided
 appropriate advice.
</p>
<h2>
 Weekly IRC Meetings
</h2>
<p>
 DotGNU holds weekly meetings to discuss any issues
 of relevance; to allow the developers to catch up
 with each other; and to allow new members to ask
 questions and find out how to join in.
</p>
<p>
 The meetings are conducted via IRC in the channel
 times:
</p>
<pre>
    Saturday 1000 UTC
    Saturday 2200 UTC
</pre>
<p>
 The first is best for DotGNU members east of UTC
 and the second is best for DotGNU members west
 of UTC.  Some of the key DotGNU members attend
 both meetings.
</p>
<p>
 The logs of #dotgnu are always available here:
 <a href="http://ajmitch.dhis.org/~ajmitch/logs/dotgnu">http://ajmitch.dhis.org/~ajmitch/logs/dotgnu</a>
</p>
<p>
 Note: the times are UTC, not GMT.  That is, they
 do not include daylight savings adjustments during
 the northern summer.  If you use the GNU operating system
 (e.g. GNU/Linux, the popular combination of the GNU system
 with the kernel called Linux) or a Unix system,
 then the command "date; date -u" will give you
 your current time in both local and UTC, allowing
 you do determine when the next meeting will occur.

 of <a href="http://freedevelopers.net">FreeDevelopers</a>
 and the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a>.
 The DotGNU system will be a well-integrated part of the
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU system</a> and it will
 also be made available to the users of all other
 widely-used operation systems.  If you wish to receive
 important announcements about the DotGNU project, please

<h3>
 Where will DotGNU compete with the Microsoft .Net
 and Hailstorm products?
</h3>
<p>
 In all areas.
</p>
<p>
 Just like it's the goal of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a>
 to create a complete operating system that makes it completely
 unnecessary to use a non-free operating system like e.g. Microsoft
 Windows, it's the goal of the DotGNU project to be a complete
 competitor to Microsoft's ".Net initiative" and "Hailstorm" products.
</p>
<p>
 The DotGNU project will compete with Microsoft for end-users,
 business customers and developers.
</p>
<p>
 Microsoft Windows had a huge head start over GNU/Linux in terms
 of user-friendliness to end users.  In spite of Microsoft's vast
 resources, GNU/Linux is already better than Microsoft Windows in
 some areas, and catching up fast in most others.
</p>
<p>
 We believe that the same kind of success story is possible with
 the DotGNU project.  The main difference is that this time,
 Microsoft doesn't have such a big head start.
</p>
<h3>
 What will DotGNU do that those products also want to do?
</h3>
<p>
 The DotGNU system will deliver the same and better benefits to end
 users and business customers, but we will be very careful that no
 company or other organization can gain any monopoly-like power over
 the system.
</p>
<h3>
 How will DotGNU be different from those Microsoft products?
</h3>
<p>
 The DotGNU project will use good ideas from Microsoft as a
 source of inspiration, and Microsoft will probably also use
 good ideas from the DotGNU project as a source of inspiration.
</p>
<p>
 The big difference is that there is a single company (Microsoft)
 in the center of the universe of the ".Net initiative" and
 "Hailstorm" products,  while the DotGNU project creates a
 framework where anyone who wants can offer every service.
 For example, with DotGNU every Internet Service Provider (ISP)
 can offer the equivalent of Microsoft's "Passport" service,
 and the ISP can customize and modify this service according to
 their customers' needs.
</p>
<p>
 In the DotGNU system, the paradigm of decentralization goes so far
 that whenever an Application Service Provider (ASP) makes a program
 available to a customer, the customer is not forced to use the program
 only on the Application Service Provider's computers.  The customers
 can download the program and use it locally on their own PCs.  This is
 in strong contrast to the Microsoft's vision for
 <a href="web-services.html">"web services"</a>.
</p>
<h3>
 What do you guys think about Hailstorm and Passport?
</h3>
<p>
 Hailstorms tend to be destructive.  And one should not need to use a
 passport in one's own country.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<h3>
 What do you guys think of Microsoft's .Net and Hailstorm efforts?
</h3>
<p>
 Dangerous stuff.  It is often said that the price of freedom is
 eternal vigilance.<sup>3</sup> Unless we counter them, Microsoft's efforts

  This truth was popularized by Thomas Jefferson (1743 - 1826).
  The original source seems to be a speech by John Philpot Curran,
  who said "It is the common fate of the indolent to see their
  rights become a prey to the active. The condition upon which God hath
  given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he
  break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the
  punishment of his guilt." - <em>John Philpot Curran: Speech upon the
  Right of Election, 1790. (Speeches. Dublin, 1808.)</em>
